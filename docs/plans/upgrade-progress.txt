Native compilation audit: COMPATIBLE

Audit performed: 2025-11-23

Summary:
All source files in org-gtd.el are compatible with native compilation.

Findings:

1. Lexical Binding (Task 15):
   - All .el files have lexical-binding: t in their headers
   - No changes required

2. eval/load Pattern Audit (Task 16):
   - Only one `eval` usage found in org-gtd-configure.el:96
   - Context: Configuration system evaluating user-provided list forms
   - Location: Not in hot path - only during item configuration
   - Impact: LOW - eval is used for user customization expressions, not in performance-critical code
   - Analysis: This is configuration-time evaluation, not runtime hot path
   - Native compilation: Compatible - configuration happens infrequently

3. load-related variables:
   - load-in-progress: Used for conditional validation during byte compilation (org-gtd-core.el:110)
   - org-gtd--loading-p: Buffer-local flag to prevent circular loading (org-gtd-core.el:340)
   - Usage: Both are guard conditions, not dynamic loading
   - Native compilation: Compatible - standard Emacs patterns

4. Autoload patterns:
   - Standard ;;;###autoload cookies throughout
   - Generated autoloads file: org-gtd-autoloads.el
   - Native compilation: Compatible - standard autoload mechanism

Conclusion:
org-gtd.el is fully compatible with native compilation. The single eval usage
is in a configuration helper function that runs infrequently. No hot-path eval
or dynamic code loading detected. All files use lexical binding.

Recommendation: Ready for Emacs 28.1+ native compilation support.
