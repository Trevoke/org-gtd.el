#+TITLE: Sam's GTD Journey
#+AUTHOR: org-gtd
#+DESCRIPTION: A narrative guide to adopting org-gtd, following one person's progressive journey from overwhelmed to organized.

* Introduction

This is a story about Sam, a software developer who felt constantly overwhelmed by too many things to remember. Follow along as Sam discovers org-gtd and progressively adopts its features over several weeks.

*Who is this for?*

- You've installed org-gtd but aren't sure how to start using it
- You learn better through stories than reference manuals
- You want to see how the features connect in a real workflow

*How to use this guide*

Read it like a story. Each "week" introduces new problems and solutions. Try the commands as Sam tries them. By the end, you'll understand the complete org-gtd workflow through lived experience.

*Prerequisites*

You should have org-gtd installed and configured. If not, see the [[info:org-gtd#Installing][Installation guide]] first.

* Week 1: Getting Out of My Head

** Monday Morning

Sam stares at their monitor, overwhelmed. In the last hour:

- Their manager mentioned a deadline change
- A colleague asked for code review
- They remembered they need to call the dentist
- An idea for improving the build system popped up
- They got an email about renewing a software license

None of it is written down. All of it is swirling in Sam's head, creating anxiety. Where do they even start?

Sam has heard about "Getting Things Done" and org-gtd. Today feels like the right day to try it.

** The First Capture

Sam opens Emacs and tries the capture command:

#+begin_example
C-c d c
#+end_example

A capture buffer appears. Sam types the first thing on their mind:

#+begin_example
Call dentist to schedule cleaning
#+end_example

They press ~C-c C-c~ to save.

That felt... good. One thing out of their head.

Sam captures the others:

#+begin_example
C-c d c → Review Alex's pull request
C-c d c → Update project deadline in tracker
C-c d c → Idea: improve build caching
C-c d c → Renew IDE license before Friday
#+end_example

Five captures, maybe two minutes. Everything that was bouncing around in Sam's head is now in the inbox.

*Sam notices*: The capture buffer is simple. No decisions required. Just get it out of your head. This matches what Sam read about GTD—capture is about speed, not organization.

** Processing the Inbox

Sam has five things in the inbox. What now?

#+begin_example
C-c d p
#+end_example

The first item appears: "Call dentist to schedule cleaning"

Sam sees a buffer where they can edit the item. Do they need to add anything? It's pretty clear as-is. The dentist's number is already in his phone. Sam presses:

#+begin_example
C-c c
#+end_example

A transient menu appears with options:

#+begin_example
[s] Single action    [p] Project    [c] Calendar
[d] Delegate         [t] Tickler    [y] Someday/Maybe
[k] Knowledge        [q] Quick action    [x] Trash
#+end_example

** Making the First Decision

"Call dentist" is one thing Sam needs to do, at some point, but not at a specific time. That sounds like a *single action*.

Sam presses *[s]*.

The item disappears from the inbox. Sam doesn't see where it went, but trusts the system. One down, four to go.

** More Decisions

The inbox shows the next item: "Review Alex's pull request"

Single action again. Press *[s]*.

Next: "Update project deadline in tracker"

Wait—Sam needs to do this today because the team meeting is this afternoon. That's calendar-specific.

Sam presses *[c]* for Calendar.

A date prompt appears. Sam enters today's date. Done.

Next: "Idea: improve build caching"

This isn't actionable right now. It's an idea Sam might pursue someday. That's *[y]* for Someday/Maybe.

Last: "Renew IDE license before Friday"

This needs to happen before a deadline, but not at a specific time. Single action with a deadline? Sam thinks... actually, single action works. They can add a deadline later if needed.

Press *[s]*.

*Sam notices*: Each decision took seconds. The transient menu made it obvious what the choices were. No agonizing required.

** Seeing What's Actionable

Sam's inbox is empty. Where did everything go?

#+begin_example
C-c d e
#+end_example

The engage view appears:

#+begin_example
Headlines with NEXT keyword:
  NEXT Call dentist to schedule cleaning
  NEXT Review Alex's pull request
  NEXT Renew IDE license before Friday

Calendar items for today:
  TODO Update project deadline in tracker    Scheduled: <today>
#+end_example

*Sam's revelation*: This is the answer to "what should I work on?" Four things. Not the infinite list in their head—four concrete next actions.

Sam feels calmer already. They know what the options are.

** Getting Things Done

Sam picks up the phone and calls the dentist. Appointment scheduled for next month.

Now, how to mark it done?

Sam navigates to the engage view (~C-c d e~), finds "Call dentist", and presses *t* to change the TODO state. They select *DONE*.

The item disappears from the list.

*Sam checks*: Three items remain in the engage view. Clean. Simple. No completed items cluttering the view.

** End of Day Reflection

Sam completed three tasks today:
- Called the dentist
- Updated the deadline (team noticed and appreciated it!)
- Reviewed Alex's PR

Two items remain for tomorrow:
- Renew IDE license
- The build caching idea is safely stored in Someday/Maybe

*What Sam learned*:

1. *Capture* is fast (~C-c d c~)—don't overthink, just write
2. *Process* happens one item at a time (~C-c d p~)—make decisions quickly
3. *Organize* is choosing a category—the transient menu makes it obvious
4. *Engage* shows what's actionable (~C-c d e~)—not everything, just next actions
5. *Done* removes it from the list—no manual cleanup needed

** Tuesday: Building the Habit

Sam's morning starts with three new captures:

#+begin_example
C-c d c → Reply to Sarah's email about the API
C-c d c → Book flight for conference
C-c d c → Fix failing CI test in main branch
#+end_example

Process them:
- Reply to Sarah → Single action
- Book flight → Single action (or Calendar if there's a deadline)
- Fix CI → Single action

Check engage view: Five items now, including the license renewal from yesterday.

*Sam's routine emerges*:
- Morning: Capture whatever came in overnight
- After capturing: Process inbox to zero
- Throughout day: Check engage view when deciding what to do next
- When done with something: Mark it DONE

This takes maybe 5 minutes a day. But Sam's head is clear.

** Friday: Archiving

It's Friday. Sam has completed seven items this week. The engage view shows just two remaining next actions.

But what happened to all those done items? Where did they go?

Sam runs:

#+begin_example
M-x org-gtd-archive-completed-items
#+end_example

The archived items move to an archive file, keeping the active files clean.

*Sam learns*: Archiving is for weekly review, not daily. Let completed items accumulate for a few days, then archive them all at once. Some people look at their archives to see what they accomplished.

** Week 1 Summary

Sam went from "everything in my head" to "everything in the system" in one week.

The workflow:

| Action | Command | When |
|--------|---------|------|
| Capture | ~C-c d c~ | Anytime something comes up |
| Process | ~C-c d p~ | After capturing, clear the inbox |
| Engage | ~C-c d e~ | When deciding what to work on |
| Done | ~t~ in agenda | When you finish something |
| Archive | ~M-x org-gtd-archive-completed-items~ | Weekly |

*What Sam hasn't learned yet*:
- How to handle multi-step work (projects)
- How to filter by context (work vs home)
- How to reflect on life balance (areas of focus)

That comes next.

* Week 2: Discovering Projects

** The Multi-Step Problem

Sam gets an assignment: "Implement the new authentication feature."

This isn't a single action. It has steps:
1. Read the auth spec
2. Implement the token validation
3. Write unit tests
4. Update the API documentation
5. Get code review from security team

Sam tries to capture it:

#+begin_example
C-c d c → Implement new authentication feature
#+end_example

But that's not actionable. What's the /next/ action? Reading the spec.

Should Sam capture five separate items? That seems wrong—they're all part of one thing.

** Capturing as a Project

Sam tries something different. In the capture buffer:

#+begin_example
* Implement authentication feature
** Read the auth spec document
** Implement token validation
** Write unit tests for auth
** Update API documentation
** Get security team code review
#+end_example

Notice the structure:
- ~*~ is the project headline
- ~**~ are the tasks within the project

Sam saves with ~C-c C-c~.

** Organizing as a Project

Sam processes the inbox (~C-c d p~).

The project appears in the clarify buffer. Sam can edit it if needed—maybe add details to a task, fix a typo, reorder things.

Satisfied, Sam presses ~C-c c~ to organize.

This time, Sam chooses *[p]* for Project.

*Something magical happens*: org-gtd automatically:
- Marks "Read the auth spec document" as *NEXT*
- Marks all other tasks as *TODO*
- Creates dependency relationships (each task blocks the next)

Sam didn't have to manage any of that.

** Seeing the Project in Action

Check the engage view:

#+begin_example
C-c d e
#+end_example

#+begin_example
Headlines with NEXT keyword:
  NEXT Read the auth spec document
  NEXT Reply to Sarah's email about the API
  ...
#+end_example

Only "Read the auth spec" appears. Not the other four tasks. They're blocked—waiting for the first task to complete.

*Sam realizes*: The engage view shows actionable work. Since Sam can't implement token validation until they've read the spec, it doesn't show up. The system knows the sequence.

** Completing Project Tasks

Sam reads the spec. It takes about an hour.

In the engage view, Sam marks "Read the auth spec document" as DONE.

Refresh the view (~g~):

#+begin_example
Headlines with NEXT keyword:
  NEXT Implement token validation
  NEXT Reply to Sarah's email about the API
  ...
#+end_example

"Implement token validation" is now NEXT! The system automatically advanced the project.

*Sam's revelation*: They don't have to think about which task is next. They don't have to manually change status. Complete one task, and the next becomes available. The system handles the workflow.

** Parallel Work

A few days later, Sam has a new project: "Set up home office"

#+begin_example
* Set up home office
** Order standing desk
** Order monitor arm
** Order cable management kit
#+end_example

Wait—these don't need to be sequential. Sam can order all three things at once.

Sam organizes it as a project with *[p]*.

After organizing, Sam checks the engage view... and sees only "Order standing desk" as NEXT.

That's not right. These should all be NEXT since they're independent.

** Custom Dependencies

Sam opens the project file and looks at the tasks. Each task has properties like ~ORG_GTD_BLOCKS~ and ~ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON~ that control the sequence.

For this project, Sam wants all tasks to start as NEXT since they're independent.

Sam can either:
1. Organize as separate single actions (not a project)
2. Manually remove the dependency properties
3. Use the dependency management commands

For simple parallel work, option 1 is easiest. But for complex projects with some sequential and some parallel tasks, org-gtd provides commands to modify dependencies.

*Sam learns*: Sequential is the default because most projects have a natural order. When tasks can truly happen in parallel, there are ways to handle that.

For now, Sam reorganizes the home office items as three single actions. Simple enough.

** A Real Complex Project

The authentication feature becomes more interesting. After implementing token validation, Sam learns that documentation and code review can happen in parallel—but both need the implementation done first.

The structure:

#+begin_example
Read spec → Implement → Documentation
                     ↘
                       Code review
#+end_example

Sam could model this with custom dependencies. For now, Sam keeps it simple: let the system handle it sequentially, and if one task is blocked waiting for external review, they'll work on other things.

*Sam's principle*: Start simple. Sequential projects cover 90% of cases. Learn the advanced features when you genuinely need them.

** Week 2 Summary

Sam now handles both simple tasks and multi-step projects.

| Type | Structure | What happens |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| Single action | One headline | Goes straight to NEXT |
| Project | Nested headlines | First task is NEXT, rest are TODO |

Key behaviors:
- Projects automatically track what's next
- Completing a task advances the project
- The engage view shows only actionable work

*What Sam hasn't learned yet*:
- Filtering by context (work vs home vs errands)
- Reflecting on areas of focus

* Week 3: Working with Context

** The Context Problem

Sam's system is working great. Twenty items in their list, a mix of work and personal. But something's off.

It's 9 PM. Sam opens the engage view to figure out what to do:

#+begin_example
NEXT Implement token validation
NEXT Reply to Sarah's email about the API
NEXT Call dentist to reschedule
NEXT Order standing desk
NEXT Fix failing CI test
NEXT Research vacation destinations
NEXT Review auth spec with Bob
NEXT Check if package arrived
#+end_example

Half of these don't make sense at 9 PM:
- Can't call the dentist (office closed)
- Shouldn't do deep work tasks (brain is tired)
- Work stuff can wait until tomorrow

Sam wants to see only what's relevant /right now/.

** Introducing Tags

GTD has a concept of "context"—the conditions under which you can do something. Common contexts:

- ~@work~ - Need to be at work
- ~@home~ - Need to be at home
- ~@phone~ - Need a phone (during business hours)
- ~@computer~ - Just need a computer
- ~@errands~ - Need to be out and about

Sam decides to start tagging items with context.

** Adding Tags While Organizing

Sam captures a new item:

#+begin_example
C-c d c → Buy groceries for dinner
#+end_example

When processing and organizing as a single action, org-gtd prompts for tags. Sam types:

#+begin_example
@errands
#+end_example

Now this item is tagged. Sam can see it in the engage view with the tag.

** Retroactively Tagging

What about existing items? Sam needs to tag those too.

Sam opens the file where items are stored (~C-c d e~ then navigate to an item and press ~RET~ to open it). On the headline, Sam adds a tag:

#+begin_example
*** NEXT Call dentist to reschedule :@phone:
#+end_example

Or use org-mode's tag command: ~C-c C-c~ on a headline, then type the tag.

Sam goes through existing items and adds context tags:
- Work deep focus: ~@work~
- Work communication: ~@work~
- Phone calls: ~@phone~
- Errands: ~@errands~
- Computer anywhere: ~@computer~
- Home only: ~@home~

** Creating a Context View

Now Sam wants to filter. At 9 PM at home, show only ~@home~ or ~@computer~ items.

Sam creates a custom view:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-evening-tasks ()
  "Show tasks I can do at home in the evening."
  (interactive)
  (org-gtd-view-show
   '((name . "Evening @home")
     (filters . ((todo . "NEXT")
                 (tags . "@home|@computer"))))))
#+end_src

Now ~M-x my-evening-tasks~ shows only relevant items.

** Context View Examples

Sam creates a few more:

*Work focus time* (deep work tasks):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-work-focus ()
  "Deep work tasks for focus time."
  (interactive)
  (org-gtd-view-show
   '((name . "Work Focus")
     (filters . ((todo . "NEXT")
                 (tags . "@work"))))))
#+end_src

*Phone calls* (batch these during business hours):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-phone-calls ()
  "Phone calls to make."
  (interactive)
  (org-gtd-view-show
   '((name . "Phone Calls")
     (filters . ((todo . "NEXT")
                 (tags . "@phone"))))))
#+end_src

*Quick wins* (when you have 10 minutes between meetings):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-quick-wins ()
  "Small tasks for short time windows."
  (interactive)
  (org-gtd-view-show
   '((name . "Quick Wins")
     (filters . ((todo . "NEXT")
                 (tags . "@quick"))))))
#+end_src

** Using Context in Daily Workflow

Sam's new routine:

*Morning at work*:
1. ~C-c d e~ to see all next actions
2. ~M-x my-work-focus~ to see just work tasks
3. Pick something and do it

*Lunch break*:
1. ~M-x my-phone-calls~ to see calls to make
2. Batch them together

*Evening at home*:
1. ~M-x my-evening-tasks~ to see home/computer tasks
2. Ignore work stuff until tomorrow

** The Mental Shift

Before tags, Sam looked at their list and mentally filtered: "I can't do that one... or that one... that's work... oh, here's one I can do."

Now the view does the filtering. Sam sees only what's possible right now.

*Sam's insight*: The engage view answers "what CAN I do?" Context views answer "what SHOULD I do right now?" Both are valuable.

** Week 3 Summary

Tags add context to tasks. Combined with custom views, Sam can filter their system to match their current situation.

| Context | When to use | Example tags |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| Location | Where you are | ~@work~, ~@home~, ~@errands~ |
| Tool | What you need | ~@phone~, ~@computer~ |
| Energy | How you feel | ~@quick~, ~@deepwork~ |
| Time | When available | ~@morning~, ~@evening~ |

*Key insight*: You don't need all these tags on day one. Start with 2-3 contexts you actually use. Add more when you feel the need.

*What Sam hasn't learned yet*:
- Reflecting on life areas to maintain balance

* Week 4: Areas of Focus

** The Imbalance

It's Friday. Sam looks back at the week:
- 15 work tasks completed
- 2 personal tasks completed
- 0 health-related tasks
- 0 relationship tasks

Sam has been productive at work. But other parts of life are being neglected. Exercise hasn't happened in two weeks. They haven't called their parents in a month.

The GTD system captured everything—including things Sam wanted to do for health and relationships. But those items kept getting pushed aside in favor of work tasks.

** The Horizons of Focus

GTD talks about "horizons of focus"—different altitudes from which you view your life:

- *Runway*: Current actions (what Sam has been managing)
- *10,000 ft*: Current projects
- *20,000 ft*: Areas of focus (ongoing responsibilities)
- *30,000 ft*: Goals (1-2 year outcomes)
- *40,000 ft*: Vision (3-5 year direction)
- *50,000 ft*: Purpose (why you exist)

Sam has been living at runway level. Time to zoom out.

** Defining Areas of Focus

Areas of focus are the ongoing responsibilities and roles in your life. Sam brainstorms:

*Work*:
- Software development
- Team collaboration
- Career growth

*Personal*:
- Health & fitness
- Family relationships
- Finances
- Home maintenance

*Growth*:
- Learning
- Creative projects

These aren't tasks—they're buckets that tasks fall into. Every task should connect to an area of focus.

** Configuring Areas in org-gtd

Sam adds areas of focus to their configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-gtd-areas-of-focus
      '("Work" "Health" "Family" "Finances" "Home" "Learning" "Creative"))
#+end_src

Now when organizing items, org-gtd can prompt for area of focus (if configured to do so).

** Tagging Existing Items

Sam goes through existing items and adds area tags:
- Work tasks: no extra tag (they're obviously work)
- "Call dentist" → ~:Health:~
- "Research vacation" → ~:Family:~
- "Review investment account" → ~:Finances:~

** The Weekly Reflect

On Sunday, Sam sits down for a weekly review. Part of this is checking each area of focus:

#+begin_example
M-x org-gtd-reflect-on-areas-of-focus
#+end_example

This shows each area and whether it has active tasks:

#+begin_example
Work: 12 active tasks
Health: 0 active tasks  ← WARNING
Family: 1 active task
Finances: 0 active tasks ← WARNING
Home: 3 active tasks
Learning: 1 active task
Creative: 0 active tasks
#+end_example

*Sam sees the problem*: Health and Finances have zero active tasks. These areas are being neglected.

** Creating Balance

Sam captures tasks for neglected areas:

#+begin_example
C-c d c → Schedule gym session for Monday      :Health:
C-c d c → Review monthly budget                :Finances:
C-c d c → Research 401k contribution changes   :Finances:
C-c d c → Call parents this weekend            :Family:
#+end_example

Process and organize these. Now the reflection view looks healthier:

#+begin_example
Work: 12 active tasks
Health: 1 active task
Family: 2 active tasks
Finances: 2 active tasks
Home: 3 active tasks
Learning: 1 active task
Creative: 0 active tasks
#+end_example

Creative is still empty, but Sam decides that's okay for now—they're focused on other things this month.

** The Higher Perspective

Areas of focus aren't just for balance. They answer important questions:

*"Am I working on what matters?"*

If all your tasks are in "Work" and none are in "Health," you might be productive but unbalanced.

*"Should I take on this new commitment?"*

Before saying yes, check: which area does this serve? Is that area already overloaded?

*"What can I drop?"*

If an area has too many tasks, some might not be essential. Review with area in mind.

** Creating Area Views

Sam creates views for periodic reflection:

*What am I doing for my health?*

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-health-review ()
  "Review health-related items."
  (interactive)
  (org-gtd-view-show
   '((name . "Health Review")
     (filters . ((area-of-focus . "Health"))))))
#+end_src

*What projects am I running at work?*

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(defun my-work-projects ()
  "Review work projects."
  (interactive)
  (org-gtd-view-show
   '((name . "Work Projects")
     (filters . ((type . project)
                 (area-of-focus . "Work"))))))
#+end_src

** Sam's Weekly Reflect Routine

Every Sunday, Sam:

1. *Clear the inbox* - Process any remaining items
2. *Review each area of focus* - Does each have appropriate attention?
3. *Check stuck projects* - Any projects that need a push?
4. *Review Someday/Maybe* - Anything to activate or delete?
5. *Plan the week* - What must happen this week?

This takes about 30 minutes and provides clarity for the week ahead.

** Week 4 Summary

Areas of focus connect daily tasks to life's bigger picture.

| Level | Timeframe | Question |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| Actions | Today | What can I do right now? |
| Projects | Weeks | What multi-step work is active? |
| Areas | Ongoing | Am I maintaining all my responsibilities? |

*Key insight*: You can be very productive at the wrong things. Areas of focus help ensure you're working on what matters.

* Where Sam Is Now

Four weeks later, Sam has a complete GTD system:

** Daily Workflow

1. *Capture* - Things come up, they go in the inbox (~C-c d c~)
2. *Process* - Clear inbox to zero, decide on each item (~C-c d p~)
3. *Engage* - See what's actionable, filtered by context (~C-c d e~ or custom views)
4. *Do* - Complete tasks, mark them DONE

** Weekly Workflow

1. *Reflect on areas* - Check that all life areas have attention
2. *Review projects* - Ensure active projects have next actions
3. *Process Someday/Maybe* - Activate, delete, or keep
4. *Archive completed* - Clean up done items
5. *Plan ahead* - What must happen this week?

** The System Sam Uses

| Feature | How Sam uses it |
|---------|-----------------|
| Single actions | Quick tasks with no dependencies |
| Projects | Multi-step work with automatic sequencing |
| Tags | Context filtering (~@work~, ~@home~, ~@phone~) |
| Areas of focus | Balance checking during weekly review |
| Custom views | Context-specific and area-specific views |
| Someday/Maybe | Ideas and possibilities for later |
| Archive | Keep active lists clean |

** What Changed

*Before org-gtd*:
- Everything in Sam's head
- Constant anxiety about forgetting things
- Worked on whatever seemed urgent
- Some life areas completely neglected

*After org-gtd*:
- Everything in the system
- Head is clear, system remembers
- Works on what's actionable and contextually appropriate
- Weekly reflect ensures nothing falls through the cracks

** Sam's Advice

If Sam were to give advice to a new org-gtd user:

1. *Start with capture and single actions*. Don't try to learn everything at once.
2. *Process daily*. An inbox with 100 items is overwhelming. Zero is peaceful.
3. *Trust the system*. If it's in org-gtd, you don't need to remember it.
4. *Add complexity as you need it*. Tags when context matters. Areas when balance matters.
5. *The weekly reflect is essential*. This is where you maintain the system.

The system is only as good as you trust it. And you only trust it if you use it consistently.

Welcome to stress-free productivity.
