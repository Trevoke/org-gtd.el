#+TITLE: Getting Things Done with org-gtd
#+AUTHOR: org-gtd
#+DESCRIPTION: A gentle guide for people who just want to do GTD, regardless of Emacs experience.

* What This Guide Is For

You've heard about GTD (Getting Things Done). You want to try it. org-gtd is your tool.

This guide teaches you exactly what you need to do GTD—nothing more. You don't need to become an Emacs expert. You just need to learn a few key combos.

*Prerequisites*:
- Emacs is installed
- org-gtd is installed and configured (see [[info:org-gtd#Installing][Installation]] if not)
- You've read (or skimmed) the GTD book, or at least understand the basic idea: capture everything, decide what it is, organize it, review regularly, do the work

* The Only Keys You Need

org-gtd uses keyboard shortcuts. Here's how to read them:

| Notation | What to press |
|----------|---------------|
| ~C-c~ | Hold Ctrl, press c |
| ~C-c d c~ | Hold Ctrl, press c, release, press d, press c |
| ~RET~ | Press Enter |

That's the whole system. Every org-gtd action starts with ~C-c d~.

* The Core Loop

GTD has a simple loop. org-gtd maps directly to it:

| GTD Step | What You Do | Key |
|----------|-------------|-----|
| *Capture* | Get it out of your head | ~C-c d c~ |
| *Clarify* | Decide what it is | (automatic during Process) |
| *Organize* | Put it where it belongs | ~C-c c~ then choose |
| *Engage* | See what's actionable | ~C-c d e~ |
| *Do* | Complete the work | (that's on you!) |

That's four key combos. Let's learn each one.

* Step 1: Capture

Something pops into your head. Don't think about it—capture it.

#+begin_example
C-c d c
#+end_example

A text box appears. Type what's on your mind:

#+begin_example
Call mom about birthday plans
#+end_example

Press ~C-c C-c~ to save it.

Done. It's in your inbox now. You'll deal with it later.

*Key insight*: Capture is about speed. Don't organize, don't categorize, just get it out of your head. You can capture 10 things in 2 minutes.

* Step 2: Process Your Inbox

You've captured some things. Now you need to decide what each one actually is.

#+begin_example
C-c d p
#+end_example

Your first inbox item appears. You can edit it if the wording isn't clear.

When you're ready to decide what kind of thing it is, press:

#+begin_example
C-c c
#+end_example

A menu appears with your choices:

#+begin_example
[s] Single action    [p] Project    [c] Calendar
[d] Delegate         [t] Tickler    [y] Someday/Maybe
[k] Knowledge        [q] Quick action    [x] Trash
#+end_example

** Which One Do I Pick?

| If it's... | Press |
|------------|-------|
| One thing I need to do, whenever | ~s~ (Single action) |
| Multiple steps to complete | ~p~ (Project) |
| Tied to a specific date/time | ~c~ (Calendar) |
| Someone else should do it | ~d~ (Delegate) |
| I want a reminder on a specific date | ~t~ (Tickler) |
| Maybe someday, no commitment | ~y~ (Someday/Maybe) |
| Reference info, not actionable | ~k~ (Knowledge) |
| I can do this in under 2 minutes right now | ~q~ (Quick action) |
| Nevermind, delete it | ~x~ (Trash) |

Most things are single actions. When in doubt, press ~s~.

After you choose, the next inbox item appears. Repeat until your inbox is empty.

*Key insight*: Process means making quick decisions. Don't agonize. You can always change things later.

* Step 3: Engage

Your inbox is empty. Everything is organized. Now: what should you work on?

#+begin_example
C-c d e
#+end_example

This shows your "engage view"—all the things you can do right now:

#+begin_example
Headlines with NEXT keyword:
  NEXT Call mom about birthday plans
  NEXT Review quarterly report
  NEXT Order new running shoes

Calendar items for today:
  TODO Team meeting at 2pm    Scheduled: <today>
#+end_example

Pick something and do it.

*Key insight*: This view shows only actionable items. Not "someday" things, not blocked tasks, not reference material. Just things you can do now.

* Step 4: Mark Things Done

When you finish something, you need to mark it complete.

In the engage view, navigate to the item (use arrow keys) and press:

#+begin_example
t
#+end_example

Select ~DONE~ from the menu.

The item disappears from your list. You did it!

* That's the Whole System

Seriously. Those four things are 90% of GTD:

1. ~C-c d c~ — Capture (get stuff out of your head)
2. ~C-c d p~ — Process (decide what things are)
3. ~C-c d e~ — Engage (see what you can work on)
4. ~t~ — Done (mark things complete)

If you do nothing else, this system will change your life.

* Projects: When Something Has Multiple Steps

Some things aren't single actions. "Plan vacation" has steps:
- Research destinations
- Book flights
- Reserve hotel
- Plan activities

When you capture, you can write the steps:

#+begin_example
C-c d c
#+end_example

#+begin_example
Plan vacation
- Research destinations
- Book flights
- Reserve hotel
- Plan activities
#+end_example

When processing, choose ~p~ for Project.

org-gtd will:
- Make "Research destinations" your next action
- Keep the other tasks waiting until you complete each step
- Automatically advance to the next task when you're done

You don't have to manage the sequence. Just complete tasks and the system advances.

* Someday/Maybe: Ideas for Later

Not everything is actionable. Some things are just ideas:

- "Learn to play guitar"
- "Visit Japan"
- "Start a podcast"

These go in Someday/Maybe (~y~ when organizing).

They won't show up in your engage view. They're safely stored for your weekly review, when you decide if any of them are ready to become real.

* Calendar: Time-Specific Items

Some things must happen at a specific time:

- Doctor appointment on Tuesday
- Project deadline on Friday
- Meeting at 3pm

These go in Calendar (~c~ when organizing). You'll be prompted for the date.

They show up in your engage view on the relevant day.

* The Weekly Review

GTD works because you maintain it. Once a week (maybe Sunday evening):

1. *Empty your inbox* - Process anything that accumulated
2. *Check your calendar* - What's coming up?
3. *Review your projects* - Are they all moving forward?
4. *Look at Someday/Maybe* - Ready to activate anything?

org-gtd has commands to help:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| ~M-x org-gtd-reflect-stuck-projects~ | Find projects without next actions |
| ~M-x org-gtd-reflect-someday-review~ | Review your someday items |
| ~M-x org-gtd-archive-completed-items~ | Clean up done items |

*Key insight*: The weekly review is what makes GTD trustworthy. If you review regularly, you can trust that nothing falls through the cracks.

* Troubleshooting

** "I pressed the wrong key"

Press ~C-g~ to cancel whatever is happening. Start over.

** "I organized something wrong"

Find the item in your files, change its properties, or delete it and capture it again. Nothing is permanent.

** "My inbox won't clear"

Keep pressing ~C-c c~ and choosing a category for each item. They'll disappear one by one.

** "The engage view is empty"

Either you have nothing to do (congratulations!) or everything is in Someday/Maybe or blocked waiting for other tasks. Check your someday list and projects.

* Next Steps

You now know enough to use org-gtd effectively. Use it for a week before learning more.

But honestly? Capture, process, engage, done. That's GTD. Everything else is refinement.

Welcome to stress-free productivity.
