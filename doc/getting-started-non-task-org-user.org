#+TITLE: Adding Task Management to Your Org-Mode Setup
#+AUTHOR: org-gtd
#+DESCRIPTION: A guide for org-mode users who use it for notes, writing, or research—not tasks—and want to add GTD.

* What This Guide Is For

You use org-mode, but not for task management. Maybe you:

- Take notes or build a personal knowledge base (org-roam, Zettelkasten, etc.)
- Write documents, papers, or books
- Do literate programming with org-babel
- Maintain a personal wiki
- Keep a journal
- Manage your Emacs config with tangled org files

You know org syntax—headings, links, properties, maybe even source blocks. But you've never touched org-agenda, org-capture for tasks, or TODO keywords beyond the occasional checkbox.

Now you want to manage tasks too, using GTD. This guide shows you how to add task management alongside your existing org usage—without touching your notes, writing, or other files.

*Key insight*: org-gtd creates its own files. Your existing org files stay exactly as they are.

* The 3-Minute Setup

You need exactly three things configured:

** 1. TODO Keywords

Add this to your config:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))
#+end_src

This tells org-mode what task states exist. Don't worry—this won't add TODO to your notes files unless you type it.

** 2. org-gtd Configuration

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Where GTD files live (separate from your notes)
(setq org-gtd-directory "~/gtd/")

;; Map GTD concepts to keywords
(setq org-gtd-keyword-mapping
      '((todo . "TODO")
        (next . "NEXT")
        (wait . "WAIT")
        (done . "DONE")
        (canceled . "CNCL")))

;; Tell org-agenda to only look at GTD files (not your notes)
(setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))

;; Required for project dependencies
(org-edna-mode 1)
#+end_src

** 3. Key Bindings

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c d c") 'org-gtd-capture)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c d e") 'org-gtd-engage)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c d p") 'org-gtd-process-inbox)

(with-eval-after-load 'org-gtd
  (define-key org-gtd-clarify-mode-map (kbd "C-c c") 'org-gtd-organize))
#+end_src

Restart Emacs. You're ready.

* Your First Task (2 Minutes)

** Capture Something

#+begin_example
C-c d c
#+end_example

Type: "Try out org-gtd"

Press ~C-c C-c~ to save.

** Process It

#+begin_example
C-c d p
#+end_example

Your task appears. Press ~C-c c~ to organize it, then ~s~ for "single action."

** See Your Tasks

#+begin_example
C-c d e
#+end_example

Your task appears in the "engage" view—a list of things you can work on.

*That's GTD*: Capture → Process → Engage. Everything else is refinement.

* How This Stays Separate From Your Notes

** Different Files

org-gtd creates files in =~/gtd/= (or wherever you set ~org-gtd-directory~):

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| ~inbox.org~ | Where captures land |
| ~org-gtd-tasks.org~ | All organized items (actions, projects, calendar, etc.) |

All GTD categories (Actions, Projects, Calendar, Tickler, Delegated, Someday/Maybe) are stored as top-level headings within ~org-gtd-tasks.org~. These headings are created automatically when you first organize an item into that category.

Your notes stay in your notes directory. org-gtd never touches them.

** Different Agenda

~org-agenda-files~ controls what org-agenda scans. We set it to only include org-gtd-directory:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))
#+end_src

This means:
- ~C-c d e~ (org-gtd-engage) shows only GTD tasks
- ~M-x org-agenda~ shows only GTD tasks
- Your notes files are never scanned for TODOs

** Different Capture

~org-gtd-capture~ has its own templates that target the GTD inbox. Your notes might have their own capture templates—those are separate:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Your notes capture (if you have one)
(setq org-capture-templates
      '(("n" "Note" entry (file "~/notes/inbox.org")
         "* %?\n%U")))

;; org-gtd adds its own templates under "d" prefix
;; They don't interfere with each other
#+end_src

* Understanding the GTD Workflow

If you're new to GTD itself, here's the mental model:

** The Problem GTD Solves

You have stuff floating in your head:
- "I should call the dentist"
- "Need to review that paper"
- "Buy groceries"
- "That project idea I had"

This creates mental clutter. You can't relax because you're trying to remember everything.

** The GTD Solution

1. *Capture* everything into a trusted system (not your head)
2. *Clarify* what each thing actually is
3. *Organize* it by type (task, project, someday idea, reference)
4. *Reflect* regularly to keep the system current
5. *Engage* by working from your organized lists

org-gtd implements this workflow.

** The Daily Loop

#+begin_example
Something pops in your head
    ↓
C-c d c (capture it)
    ↓
Later: C-c d p (process inbox)
    ↓
Choose what it is (single action, project, someday, etc.)
    ↓
C-c d e (see what to work on)
    ↓
Do the work, mark done
#+end_example

* Types of Things in GTD

When you process an item (~C-c c~), you choose what type it is:

| Key | Type | Use when... |
|-----|------|-------------|
| ~s~ | Single action | One task, do whenever |
| ~p~ | Project | Multiple steps needed |
| ~c~ | Calendar | Must happen at specific date/time |
| ~d~ | Delegate | Someone else should do it |
| ~t~ | Tickler | Remind me on a specific date |
| ~y~ | Someday/Maybe | Maybe later, no commitment |
| ~k~ | Knowledge | Reference info (goes to archive) |
| ~q~ | Quick action | Do it right now (< 2 min) |
| ~x~ | Trash | Never mind, delete it |

*Most things are single actions*. When in doubt, press ~s~.

* Connecting Tasks to Your Notes (Optional)

You might want to link tasks to your notes. This is easy with org links.

** Link a Task to a Note

When capturing or clarifying a task, add a link:

#+begin_example
Review [[file:~/notes/papers/smith2024.org][Smith 2024 paper]]
#+end_example

The task lives in GTD files; the link points to your note.

** Link a Note to a Task

In your notes, you can link to GTD tasks using org-id:

#+begin_example
See also: [[id:abc123][Related project task]]
#+end_example

(Get the ID from the task's properties with ~M-x org-id-copy~)

** Keep Them Separate

The key insight: tasks and notes serve different purposes.

- *Notes* = knowledge, reference, writing (permanent or long-lived)
- *Tasks* = actions, commitments, projects (temporary—they get done)

org-gtd manages the temporary action layer. Your notes remain your knowledge layer.

* If You Use org-roam

org-roam users often wonder how GTD fits. Here's the model:

#+begin_example
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Your Brain                │
├──────────────────┬──────────────────┤
│   Knowledge      │    Actions       │
│   (org-roam)     │    (org-gtd)     │
│                  │                  │
│   • Notes        │   • Tasks        │
│   • Ideas        │   • Projects     │
│   • References   │   • Commitments  │
│   • Connections  │   • Calendar     │
└──────────────────┴──────────────────┘
#+end_example

They're complementary:
- org-roam captures what you *know*
- org-gtd captures what you need to *do*

Keep them in separate directories. Link between them when useful.

* If You Use org-babel / Literate Config

Your literate programming files stay untouched. org-gtd:
- Doesn't scan your config files for TODOs
- Doesn't modify files outside ~org-gtd-directory~
- Uses its own capture templates

If a task relates to your config ("refactor init.el"), capture it in org-gtd. The task might link to your config file, but the task itself lives in GTD.

* Weekly Maintenance

GTD works because you maintain it. Once a week (10-15 minutes):

1. *Empty inbox*: Process any remaining captures (~C-c d p~)
2. *Review tasks*: Scan your engage view (~C-c d e~)—anything outdated?
3. *Check projects*: ~M-x org-gtd-reflect-stuck-projects~—any stuck?
4. *Review someday*: ~M-x org-gtd-reflect-someday-review~—activate anything?

This keeps the system trustworthy. If you review weekly, you can trust that nothing falls through the cracks.

| ~M-x org-gtd-archive-completed-items~ | Clean up done tasks |

* Complete Configuration

Here's everything in one block:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; ============================================================
;; org-gtd for non-task org-mode users
;; ============================================================

;; TODO keywords (won't affect your existing files)
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))

;; GTD configuration
(setq org-gtd-directory "~/gtd/")  ; Keep separate from notes
(setq org-gtd-keyword-mapping
      '((todo . "TODO")
        (next . "NEXT")
        (wait . "WAIT")
        (done . "DONE")
        (canceled . "CNCL")))

;; IMPORTANT: Only scan GTD directory for tasks
;; This keeps your notes out of org-agenda
(setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))

;; Required for project dependencies
(org-edna-mode 1)

;; Key bindings
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c d c") 'org-gtd-capture)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c d e") 'org-gtd-engage)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c d p") 'org-gtd-process-inbox)

(with-eval-after-load 'org-gtd
  (define-key org-gtd-clarify-mode-map (kbd "C-c c") 'org-gtd-organize))

;; Optional: mode-line inbox count
(org-gtd-mode 1)
#+end_src

* What Stays the Same

| Your current usage | Affected? |
|--------------------|-----------|
| Notes files | No—org-gtd never touches them |
| org-roam database | No—completely separate |
| org-babel tangling | No—GTD files don't tangle |
| Journal files | No—separate capture templates |
| Writing projects | No—unless you add them to agenda-files |
| Config files | No—not in agenda-files |

* Next Steps

Use org-gtd for a week with just capture → process → engage. Once that's comfortable:

- [[info:org-gtd#Projects][Projects]] — Multi-step work with automatic sequencing
- [[info:org-gtd#sams-gtd-journey][Sam's GTD Journey]] — See how features connect
- [[info:org-gtd][Full Manual]] — Complete reference

The goal is simple: get actions out of your head so you can focus on your actual work—writing, research, or whatever you use org-mode for.
