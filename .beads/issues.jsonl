(\"mediumenergy\" \"highenergy\"))\n (effort . (\u003e \"0:59\"))\n (priority . (A)))\n```\n\nItems with other tags like \"someenergy\" appear in the view where only \"mediumenergy\" and \"highenergy\" should appear.\n\n## Root Cause\n\n`org-gtd-view-lang--build-skip-function` (lines 987-1069) handles:\n- ✅ type filter\n- ✅ area-of-focus filter\n- ✅ when filter\n- ✅ priority filter\n- ✅ effort filter\n- ✅ clocked filter\n- ✅ last-clocked-out filter\n- ❌ **tags filter - NOT HANDLED**\n\nThe tags filter IS translated for org-ql (`org-gtd-view-lang--translate-tags-filter`, lines 557-559), but native agenda blocks use skip functions, and the skip function builder doesn't include tags.\n\n## Fix Required\n\n1. Create `org-gtd-pred--tags-matches` predicate in org-gtd-predicates.el\n2. Add tags handling to `org-gtd-view-lang--build-skip-function`\n3. Add tests for tags filtering with native blocks\n\n## Additional Consideration\n\nThe org-ql semantics use OR matching: `(tags \"a\" \"b\")` matches items with ANY of those tags.
