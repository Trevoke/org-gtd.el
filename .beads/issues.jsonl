In order to navigate in the project graph area, I have Ctrl-Z to switch between the two states vim vs emacs and you need the emacs state to accomplish anything in the project graph. The issue is when I press the ? mark button, there is a state change to vim keys even if I have already switched to the emacs state and when I try to Ctrl-Z to switch back to emacs state the transient graph disappears.\n\n## Partial Workaround\n\nAdding to Doom config helps with initial entry (no more C-z needed):\n```elisp\n(after! evil\n  (evil-set-initial-state 'org-gtd-graph-view-mode 'emacs))\n```\n\nBut transient still closes when C-z is pressed.\n\n## Potential Solutions\n\n1. Set `org-gtd-graph-view-mode` to emacs state by default (avoid needing C-z)\n2. User rebinds `evil-toggle-key` to something other than C-z\n3. Unbind C-z from transient-map when our transients are active\n4. Document the conflict and workaround\n\n## References\n\n- Transient manual: C-z suspends transients for later resumption\n- Evil settings: evil-toggle-key defaults to C-z\n\n## Relevant Files\n\n- org-gtd-graph-mode.el (mode derived from special-mode)\n- org-gtd-graph-transient.el (transient menu definitions)","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-28T20:54:51.545761037-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-28T21:14:18.15411661-05:00"}
