;; NOTE: Original test was buggy - it used create-reference-item instead of create-quick-action.
;; Fixed and migrated to test-eunit/acceptance/basic-workflows-test.el (quick-action-moves-to-archive)
;; The e-unit version uses the correct helper and verifies ORG_GTD="Quick".

;; This file is kept for documentation. The tests now run via e-unit.
