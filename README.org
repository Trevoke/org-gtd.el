#+TITLE: Org GTD - Get Things Done with Emacs

* First Contact

** The Problem

You know GTD. You want to practice it in Emacs.

org-mode is incredibly powerful... and incredibly complex.

Do you really need to master org-agenda's custom views, org-capture templates, and org-mode's keyword workflows just to implement David Allen's methodology?

** The Solution

*org-gtd treats Emacs and org-mode as infrastructure.*

You focus on GTD. org-gtd handles the org-mode complexity.

- Turnkey GTD workflow matching the book
- Automatic project dependency management
- Built-in views for capture/clarify/organize/engage/review
- Hooks for your customizations (effort, tags, integrations)
- Extensible for email, code tools, external sources

** Who This Is For

- You practice GTD (or want to start)
- You use Emacs (beginner to expert - we'll explain what you need)
- You want to DO work, not configure systems

* Quick Start (5 Minutes)

Get org-gtd working end-to-end: capture an item, organize it, and see it in your daily view.

** Prerequisites

- Emacs 28.1 or higher
- org-mode (included with Emacs)

** Installation

Install from MELPA:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Manually
M-x package-install RET org-gtd RET
#+end_src

** Complete Configuration (use-package)

If you use ~use-package~, copy this entire block into your init file - it includes installation, configuration, and keybindings:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package org-gtd
  :ensure t
  :after org
  :demand t
  :custom
  ;; Where org-gtd will keep its files (defaults to ~/gtd/)
  ;; (org-gtd-directory "~/my-gtd/")

  ;; Configure TODO keyword states
  (org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))

  ;; Map GTD semantic states to your keywords
  (org-gtd-keyword-mapping '((todo . "TODO")
                             (next . "NEXT")
                             (wait . "WAIT")
                             (canceled . "CNCL")))

  ;; Add org-gtd files to your agenda
  (org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))

  :config
  ;; REQUIRED: Enable org-edna for project dependencies
  (org-edna-mode 1)

  :bind
  ;; Global keybindings (work anywhere in Emacs)
  (("C-c d c" . org-gtd-capture)
   ("C-c d e" . org-gtd-engage)
   ("C-c d p" . org-gtd-process-inbox)
   ("C-c d n" . org-gtd-show-all-next)
   ("C-c d s" . org-gtd-review-stuck-projects)

   ;; Keybinding for organizing items (only works in clarify buffers)
   :map org-gtd-clarify-map
   ("C-c c" . org-gtd-organize)))
#+end_src

** Alternative: Manual Configuration

If you don't use ~use-package~, copy this into your init file and restart Emacs:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Configure org-mode TODO keywords
;; All GTD keywords must be in the same sequence
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))

;; Map GTD semantic states to your keywords
(setq org-gtd-keyword-mapping
      '((todo . "TODO")      ; tasks not ready to act on
        (next . "NEXT")      ; tasks ready to act on immediately
        (wait . "WAIT")      ; tasks blocked or delegated
        (canceled . "CNCL"))) ; tasks that won't be completed

;; Optional: Set GTD directory (defaults to ~/gtd/)
;; (setq org-gtd-directory "~/gtd/")

;; Add org-gtd files to your agenda
(setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))

;; REQUIRED: Enable org-edna for project dependencies
(org-edna-mode 1)

;; Global keybindings (work anywhere in Emacs)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c d c") 'org-gtd-capture)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c d e") 'org-gtd-engage)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c d p") 'org-gtd-process-inbox)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c d n") 'org-gtd-show-all-next)
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c d s") 'org-gtd-review-stuck-projects)

;; Keybinding for organizing items (only works in clarify buffers)
(with-eval-after-load 'org-gtd
  (define-key org-gtd-clarify-map (kbd "C-c c") 'org-gtd-organize))
#+end_src

** Your First GTD Cycle

*** 1. Capture Something

Press ~C-c d c~ (or ~M-x org-gtd-capture~).

Type: "Buy birthday gift for Alex"

Press ~C-c C-c~ to save and close.

*** 2. Process Your Inbox

Press ~C-c d p~ (or ~M-x org-gtd-process-inbox~).

You'll see a buffer with your captured item. This is the *clarify* step - edit the item to make it clear and actionable.

*** 3. Organize the Item

When you're ready to organize, press ~C-c c~ (or ~M-x org-gtd-organize~).

A menu appears asking what type of item this is. For our example:

Press ~s~ for "Single action" (a one-off task to do when possible).

org-gtd will prompt you to add tags if you want (press RET to skip).

The item is now filed into your GTD system!

*** 4. See It in Your Daily View

Press ~C-c d e~ (or ~M-x org-gtd-engage~).

You'll see an agenda view showing all your NEXT actions and scheduled items. Your item "Buy birthday gift for Alex" should be there with a NEXT state.

** What Just Happened?

You just completed the core GTD cycle:

1. *Capture* - Got something out of your head (~org-gtd-capture~)
2. *Clarify* - Made it clear and actionable (editing in the WIP buffer)
3. *Organize* - Categorized it (~org-gtd-organize~)
4. *Engage* - Saw it in your action list (~org-gtd-engage~)

The two remaining GTD steps:
- *Process* - Loop through your inbox (we did this with ~org-gtd-process-inbox~)
- *Review* - Regularly check your system (commands like ~org-gtd-review-stuck-projects~)

* What's Next

* Version Notice

** Upgrading to 4.0?

This is org-gtd 4.0.0 - a major release with flexible project dependencies and simplified configuration.

If you're upgrading from version 3.x, see the [[file:doc/org-gtd.org#upgrading][Upgrading section]] in the documentation for:
- Required configuration changes (keyword mapping)
- Required data migration command (~M-x org-gtd-upgrade-v3-to-v4~)
- What's new in 4.0

*Important*: Version 4.0 changes how projects work internally. You must run the migration for existing projects to continue working.

** What's New in 4.0

*** Flexible project dependencies!
Projects can now have parallel tasks and custom dependency relationships, not just sequential execution.

*** Simplified keyword configuration
Use ~org-gtd-keyword-mapping~ instead of multiple individual variables.

*** Declarative view language
Create custom agenda views with simple filter specifications instead of complex skip functions.

*** Better project modification
Add tasks to projects anywhere, create custom dependencies, manage complex structures.

See the full documentation for complete details.
