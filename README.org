* NOTICE
This is org-gtd 4.0.0.

Check documentation in [[doc/]] (and the info manual within emacs itself) if you're upgrading. Please report all defects as Github issues.

* What's new in 4.0:
** Flexible project dependencies!
Projects can now have parallel tasks and custom dependency relationships, not just sequential execution. Plus simplified keyword configuration and many other improvements. See [[doc/org-gtd.org][the documentation]] for details.

Use existing tags if you'd rather stick to previous versions.

* Sponsorship
I've put many hours of reading, research, and coding, to put this together. If it delivers value to you, helps you manage your life, please consider sponsoring ([[https://github.com/sponsors/Trevoke/][Github sponsors]] or [[https://www.patreon.com/LokiConsulting][Patreon]]) and allowing me to continue putting work into this package and other projects.

* Org GTD
This package tries to replicate as closely as possible the GTD workflow.
This package assumes familiarity with GTD.

This package provides a system that allows you to capture incoming things into an inbox, then process the inbox and categorize each item based on the GTD categories.  It leverages org-agenda to show today's items as well as the NEXT items.  It also has a flexible project management system that supports both sequential task execution and complex dependency relationships for parallel work.

For a comprehensive instruction manual, see the documentation:
- Either the info file (within emacs, ~C-h i m org gtd RET~)
- or in the [[doc/]] directory of the repository, there is a ~.org~ file you can peruse.

The documentation also details how to upgrade from one version to another.

** Whirlwind tour of the package
What follows is an incomplete description of the package. It is useful if you just want to take it for a test run. Read the full documentation for the full set of features and customizability.

*** Quick Configuration
Before using org-gtd, you need to configure your org-mode TODO keywords and map them to GTD semantic states:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Configure org-mode TODO keywords
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))

;; Map GTD semantics to your keywords
(setopt org-gtd-keyword-mapping
        '((todo . "TODO")      ; not ready to act
          (next . "NEXT")      ; ready to act
          (wait . "WAIT")      ; blocked/delegated
          (canceled . "CNCL"))) ; terminated

;; Add org-gtd files to your agenda
(setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))

;; Configure org-edna (REQUIRED for projects to work)
(setq org-edna-use-inheritance t)
(org-edna-mode 1)
#+end_src

*** GTD Meta

Customizable variables:
- ~org-gtd-directory~ :: Directory where org-gtd will look for its files
- ~org-gtd-areas-of-focus~ :: List of strings representing Horizon 3. See Steps 4 and 6 for further details.
*** GTD Step 1/6 : Capture
Functions:
- ~org-gtd-capture~ :: A wrapper around ~org-capture~. Use it to capture items into the GTD inbox. Will create the inbox file if it does not exist.

Customizable variables:
- ~org-gtd-capture-templates~ :: Defines behavior for ~org-gtd-capture~.

*** GTD Step 2/6 : Process
Functions:
- ~org-gtd-process-inbox~ :: Start a loop around step 3 (Clarify) for every item in the inbox.
*** GTD Step 3/6 : Clarify
Functions:
- ~org-gtd-clarify-item~ :: Call this from any org heading to clarify this item as a one-off and organize it into org-gtd.
- ~org-gtd-clarify-agenda-item~ :: Call this from any item in the agenda to clarify this item and organize it into org-gtd.
- ~org-gtd-clarify-switch-to-buffer~ :: Call this to switch back to any existing clarify buffer. Use this instead of switching back through the normal flow, as this manages some state.

Keymaps:
- ~org-gtd-clarify-map~ :: Sparse keymap for minor mode used in the clarify buffer.
*** GTD Step 4/6 : Organize
Functions:
- ~org-gtd-organize~ :: Pop up a menu asking how to organize (e.g. single action, appointment, etc.) the item at point. Great function to bind on ~org-gtd-clarify-map~.

Hooks:
- ~org-gtd-organize-hooks~ :: Series of functions that get called to decorate each item (e.g. org tags, org effort, etc.). Add ~org-gtd-set-area-of-focus~ to this one to set areas of focus on each item.
*** GTD Step 5/6 : Engage daily
Functions:
- ~org-gtd-engage~ :: Your daily view.
- ~org-gtd-engage-grouped-by-context~ :: All NEXT actions, grouped by tags beginning with =@=. This may not work if you remove ~org-set-tags-command~ from ~org-gtd-organize-hooks~.
*** GTD Step 6/6 : Review
Functions:
- ~org-gtd-oops~ :: Show all the missed appointments. Oops!
- ~org-gtd-review-area-of-focus~ :: Show an agenda view designed for one of your areas of focus.
- ~org-gtd-review-stuck-*~ :: The =*= here is any of the action types; you can find any of the ones that have fallen through the cracks.


* Directory tree
- =dev= :: used as a jail environment. Copy somewhere else and spin up with ~$ HOME="dev/" emacs~.
- =doc= :: where the documentation lives
- =test= :: where the tests are
* Community
If you want help, you can open an issue right on Github.

You're also welcome to join my [[https://discord.gg/2kAK6TfqJq][discord server]] for all conversations related to org-gtd in particular and GTD in general. Many of the ideas for org-gtd came out of my reading the GTD book, and then reading some sections multiple times, but I am in no way an expert. Defining the GTD domain, which is to say, getting to clear nomenclature with clear actions, is still a work in progress.
