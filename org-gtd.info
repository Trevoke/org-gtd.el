1 Summary
*********

This package tries to replicate as closely as possible the GTD workflow
(see diagram below).

   This package, and this documentation, assume familiarity with the
flow of GTD as described in the book.

   This package provides a system that allows you to capture incoming
things into an inbox, then process the inbox and categorize each item
based on the GTD categories.  It leverages org-agenda to show today’s
items as well as the NEXT items.  It also has a simple project
management system, which currently assumes all tasks in a project are
sequential.

2.1 Minimum emacs version now 27.2
==================================

It became too difficult for me to support 27.1.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Organize menu has changed,  Next: Easier to clarify more items,  Prev: Minimum emacs version now 272,  Up: What's new in 30

2.2 Organize menu has changed
=============================

   • Habits have their place now (h)
   • What used to be called "archive" is now called "knowledge" (k)
   • Modify project is now "Add to project" (a)

2.3 Easier to clarify more items
================================

There’s now two more powerful commands you can use to clarify almost
anything:
   • ‘org-gtd-clarify-item’
   • ‘org-gtd-clarify-agenda-item’

   These both allow you to enter a one-off clarify/organize flow.

2.4 Functions exist to create your own hooks
============================================

Make GTD truly a part of your emacs experience!  These functions take
various arguments (check the documentation in emacs) and automatically
add something to your org-gtd.  This would be useful after sending an
email, for instance.  Please share your own hooks as issues in Github or
in the discord so we can create a community library!
   • ‘org-gtd-habit-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-calendar-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-delegate-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-incubate-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-single-action-create’

2.5 Support habits
==================

Org mode’s habits now have a specific place here.

2.7 Massive API changes
=======================

The package domain now is a better match for the domain language of GTD.

   Functions use the words ‘capture’, ‘process’, ‘clarify’, ‘organize’,
‘review’.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Massive Data structure changes,  Next: Include horizons,  Prev: Massive API changes,  Up: What's new in 30

2.8 Massive Data structure changes
==================================

   • SCHEDULED and DEADLINE are intended to be used for things that have
     to start and things that have to end, respectively.  V2 abused
     them, v3 is more respectful of how org-mode wants to work.
   • We use our own timestamp property.  For compatibility with orgzly,
     we currently duplicate the timestamp into the body.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Include horizons,  Next: You can create your own project templates and insert them while clarifying,  Prev: Massive Data structure changes,  Up: What's new in 30

2.9 Include horizons
====================

   • They can be displayed while clarifying
   • There’s an optional organize-hook for areas of focus
   • There’s an agenda view for areas of focus

3.1 Upgrading
=============

If you are installing and not upgrading, you can skip this section
entirely and just go to the next section, *note Installing::.

* Menu:

* 3.0.0 <- 2.2.0: 300 <- 220.
* 2.2.0 <- 2.1.0: 220 <- 210.

3.1.1 3.0.0 <- 2.2.0
--------------------

There’s a lot here, so you may want to make yourself some tea.  We have
to cover support for org habits, upgrading data, key changes in the
configuration, a change in the menu, and the rest of the API changes.
And once that’s done, you should head back to the *note What’s new in
3.0: What's new in 30. section to see what else is available for you!

   • A note for doom emacs users

     Beta testers using doom emacs found they needed to do a fully clean
     install.  The regular upgrades did not work.  We could not find a
     clean fix.  We suspect this is related to org-mode being a very
     complex beast, but we’re not sure.

   • Support for org habits

     For the sake of keeping the ‘org-agenda-custom-commands’ as simple
     as possible, habits are now stored under headings with the property
     ‘ORG_GTD: Habits’.  The same rules for refiling apply to these
     headings.

   • Upgrading data

     Some not-inconsequential data structure changes happened under the
     hood.  To keep using ‘org-gtd’ you will need to upgrade your data,
     using ‘M-x org-gtd-upgrade-v2-to-v3’.  _Backups are always
     recommended, even though there are tests._  Note that if there are
     any habits managed by ‘org-gtd v2’ then they will be moved to a
     heading ‘* Habits’, in a file called ‘org-gtd-tasks.org’, in
     ‘org-gtd-directory’.

   • Key changes in configuration

     Here’s a table of the changes, with sample config change and
     explanations afterwards.
     2.0                              3.0
     --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     ‘org-gtd-process-mode’           ‘org-gtd-clarify-mode’
     ‘org-gtd-process-map’            ‘org-gtd-clarify-map’
     ‘org-gtd-choose’                 ‘org-gtd-organize’
     ‘org-gtd-process-item-hooks’     ‘org-gtd-organize-hooks’
     ‘org-gtd-capture-templates’      Now looks like ‘org-capture-templates’
     Projects :TRIGGER:               changed again (see below)
     ‘org-gtd-agenda-custom-config’   gone (see below)
     org file headers                 Drop ’em (see below)

        • Sample new config

               (use-package org-gtd
                 :after org
                 :quelpa (org-gtd :fetcher github :repo "trevoke/org-gtd.el"
                                  :commit "3.0.0" :upgrade t)
                 :demand t
                 :custom
                 (org-gtd-directory "~/org-gtd")
                 (org-edna-use-inheritance t)
                 (org-gtd-organize-hooks '(org-gtd-set-area-of-focus org-set-tags-command))
                 :config
                 (org-edna-mode)
                 :bind
                 (("C-c d c" . org-gtd-capture)
                  ("C-c d e" . org-gtd-engage)
                  ("C-c d p" . org-gtd-process-inbox)
                  :map org-gtd-clarify-map
                  ("C-c c" . org-gtd-organize)))

        • Projects trigger

          The new trigger line looks like this:

          ‘:TRIGGER: org-gtd-next-project-action
          org-gtd-update-project-task!’

          This allows us to define these functions as flexibly as we
          want, in the future, and that will mean we can expand what it
          means to be a project in the future.

        • ‘org-gtd-capture-templates’

          Most of you users have not had to touch this, so you probably
          won’t have a use for this section of the upgrade
          documentation.  The new data structure is now a complete
          parallel for the ‘org-capture-templates’ structure, so you can
          see how to structure it by looking at the help file for that.

          The key elements are still the same, however:
             • the template has to start with a single asterisk
             • the entry has to be ‘entry (file ,#'org-gtd-inbox-path)’

        • ‘org-gtd-agenda-custom-config’

          This customization is no longer in use.  It wasn’t an easy
          decision to make, but I have to make way for bigger, future
          changes in org-gtd over the next major releases.

          If you have an existing ‘org-gtd-agenda-custom-commands’
          setup, then you can do something like this to keep using it.
          In short, for now, create your own function, and wrap the
          definition with the ‘with-org-gtd-context’ macro.  You can see
          the source code of ‘org-gtd-engage’ for an example.

               ; only so I refer to it with a name in this snippet
               (setq my-commands org-gtd-agenda-custom commands)

               (defun my-org-gtd-engage ()
                 (interactive)
                 (with-org-gtd-context
                     (let ((org-agenda-custom-commands my-commands))
                       ; "g" is what the previous command used, replace with what you need
                       (org-agenda nil "g"))))

        • Dropping the org file headers

          The TODO keywords are now customizable (see ‘M-x
          customize-group org-gtd RET’), while they were hard-coded in
          v2.  Those hard-coded values are now the defaults, but you
          should remove the hard-coded values anyway, so remove the
          following line:

          ‘#+TODO: NEXT(n) TODO(t) WAIT(w@) | DONE(d) CNCL(c@)’

   • A change in the menu

        • Habits have their place (‘h’)
        • What used to be called "archive" is now called "knowledge"
          (‘k’)
        • Modify project is now "Add to project" (‘a’)

     Do note that that "a" got completely reassigned!  If you used to
     use it for items that went into your personal knowledge management
     system, you’ll need to retrain yourself.

     I’m very sorry about this.  In the future, you’ll be able to
     customize this UI.

   • Rest of API changes

        • ‘org-gtd-delegate’ is now ‘org-gtd-delegate-item-at-point’

          This is the function to call if you want to delegate without
          refiling.

        • ‘org-gtd-agenda-projectify’ is now ‘just
          org-gtd-clarify-agenda-item’

          V3 means you can freely clarify and organize anything in the
          agenda with the above function.

        • ‘org-gtd-agenda-delegate’ is now
          ‘org-gtd-delegate-agenda-item’

          The nomenclature changes here because of an effort to, over
          time, define a better language for GTD, slicing vertically
          through org-mode features.

        • ‘org-gtd-cancel-project’ is now ‘org-gtd-project-cancel’

          Same reason as above.

        • ‘org-gtd-agenda-cancel-project’ is now
          ‘org-gtd-project-cancel-from-agenda’

          Same reason as above.

        • ‘org-gtd-show-stuck-projects’ is now
          ‘org-gtd-reflect-stuck-projects’

          Same reason as above.

   • That’s it!

3.1.2 2.2.0 <- 2.1.0
--------------------

   • respect org-mode’s org-reverse-note-order variable

     The upgrade to ‘2.0.1’ allowed addition of a task as the first task
     of an existing project while organizing a clarified item.  ‘2.0.2’
     allows the user to choose what they prefer.  Correspondingly, it
     lets the ‘org-mode’ variable ‘org-reverse-note-order’ operate as it
     should.  In your configuration, use:
          (setq org-reverse-note-order t)   ;; refile to the top of the list, or
          (setq org-reverse-note-order nil) ;; refile to the bottom of the list

     Note that if you’re upgrading directly from 2.0.0 you still need to
     make the adjustment to the TRIGGER for your project headings.

3.1.3 2.1.0 <- 2.0.0
--------------------

   • Update org-edna trigger

     In order for project modification to work, you will need to go to
     every Project heading that you have.  You will find the following:
          :PROPERTIES:
          :TRIGGER: next-sibling todo!(NEXT)
          :ORG_GTD: Projects
          :END:

     And you will need to update the trigger so it looks like this:
          :PROPERTIES:
          :TRIGGER: relatives(forward-no-wrap todo-only 1 no-sort) todo!(NEXT)
          :ORG_GTD: Projects
          :END:

     Now be sure to set the following variable in your config file,
     before org-gtd loads, to disable the loud warning:

          (setq org-gtd-update-ack "2.1.0")

     That is it!  You’re ready to add tasks to existing projects while
     processing the inbox.

3.1.4 2.0.0 <- 1.1.x
--------------------

   • Configuration

     Org GTD now handles dependency loading more intelligently, so you
     no longer need the overly complicated setup of ‘org-gtd’,
     ‘org-agenda’ and ‘org-capure’ in your config for dependency
     loading.  You now only need ‘org-gtd’.  If you are using
     ‘use-package’ then the following is the minimal config required.

          (use-package org-gtd :after 'org)

     You no longer need to configure ‘org-agenda-property-list’
     yourself.  Org GTD now manages the context with a macro,
     ‘with-org-gtd-context’.  Any prior configuration of this subpackage
     can be handled as you did before.

     You no longer need to configure ‘org-agenda-files’.  Same reason as
     above.  This allows you to use org-gtd without destroying your
     previous setup, and makes it easier to try org-gtd and then get rid
     of it if you don’t like it.

     You no longer need to configure ‘org-agenda-custom-commands’.  Now
     there’s ‘org-gtd-agenda-custom-commands’ to take the relay - see
     the variable documentation for more information.

     The org-capture templates are now simplified and managed by
     ‘org-gtd-capture-templates’.  If you did not change the default
     configuration, then you can just remove what you had.  Read the
     variable documentaton for further information.

        • Example upgrade

          My org-gtd config for 1.x was as follows:
               (use-package org-gtd
                 :after org
                 :quelpa (org-gtd :fetcher github :repo "trevoke/org-gtd.el"
                                  :commit "1.1.1" :upgrade t)
                 :demand t
                 :custom
                 (org-gtd-directory "~/org-gtd")
                 (org-agenda-property-list '("DELEGATED_TO"))
                 (org-edna-use-inheritance t)
                 :config
                 (org-edna-load)
                 :bind
                 (("C-c d c" . org-gtd-capture)
                  ("C-c d a" . org-agenda-list)
                  ("C-c d p" . org-gtd-process-inbox)
                  ("C-c d n" . org-gtd-show-all-next)
                  ("C-c d s" . org-gtd-show-stuck-projects)
                  :map org-gtd-process-map
                  ("C-c c" . org-gtd-choose)))


               (use-package org-agenda
                 :ensure nil
                 :no-require t
                 :after (org-gtd)
                 :custom
                 (org-agenda-skip-deadline-if-done t)
                 (org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done t)
                 (org-agenda-files `(,org-gtd-directory))
                 (org-agenda-custom-commands '(("g" "Scheduled today and all NEXT items" ((agenda "" ((org-agenda-span 1))) (todo "NEXT"))))))

               (use-package org-capture
                 :ensure nil
                 :after org-gtd
                 :config
                 (setq org-capture-templates `(("i" "Inbox"
                                              entry (file ,(org-gtd--path org-gtd-inbox-file-basename))
                                              "* %?\n%U\n\n  %i"
                                              :kill-buffer t)
                                             ("t" "Todo with link"
                                              entry (file ,(org-gtd--path org-gtd-inbox-file-basename))
                                              "* %?\n%U\n\n  %i\n  %a"
                                              :kill-buffer t))))

          And my config for 2.0 is:
               (use-package org-gtd
                 :after org
                 :quelpa (org-gtd :fetcher github :repo "trevoke/org-gtd.el"
                                  :commit "2.0.0" :upgrade t)
                 :demand t
                 :custom
                 (org-gtd-directory "~/org-gtd")
                 (org-edna-use-inheritance t)
                 :config
                 (org-edna-mode)
                 :bind
                 (("C-c d c" . org-gtd-capture)
                  ("C-c d e" . org-gtd-engage)
                  ("C-c d p" . org-gtd-process-inbox)
                  ("C-c d n" . org-gtd-show-all-next)
                  ("C-c d s" . org-gtd-show-stuck-projects)
                  :map org-gtd-process-map
                  ("C-c c" . org-gtd-choose)))

   • Relevant commands with new names

        • ‘org-agenda-list’ -> ‘org-gtd-engage’
        • ‘org-gtd-clarify-finalize’ -> ‘org-gtd-choose’ (see the
          section on Key bindings below)

   • heading states (TODO, etc.)

     You need to rename CANCELED to CNCL.  a simple string replace in
     the ‘org-gtd-directory’ will do the trick.

   • Differentiating GTD types of items

     Org GTD no longer uses the name of the heading to figure out how to
     refile things, and which headings are useful.  Instead it uses a
     custom Org property called ORG_GTD. This means you are free to
     rename the existing headings whatever you want, but you DO need to
     make some adjustments to your current files.

     If you would like to add new refile targets, it’s simple, follow
     these instructions.

     For projects, make sure the heading has the following two
     properties.
          :PROPERTIES:
          :TRIGGER: next-sibling todo!(NEXT)
          :ORG_GTD: Projects
          :END:

     For other headings, make sure there is an ORG_GTD property, like
     for the project, above.

     The other ORG_GTD properties are set as follows.  Note that Single
     and Delegated actions are together now, so you can merge those
     headings if you want.

     Scheduled actions
          ‘ORG_GTD: Calendar’
     Single & Delegated actions
          ‘ORG_GTD: Actions’
     Incubated actions
          ‘ORG_GTD: Incubated’

     For incubated actions, version 1.x of Org GTD asked for
     second-level heading, such as ‘*To Read’.  No more - these are now
     top-level headings, exactly as described above, with a heading
     property of ‘ORG_GTD: Incubated’.

   • Multiple refile targets

     There is a new variable, ‘org-gtd-refile-to-any-target’.  By
     default this variable is set to ‘t’.  This means that Org GTD will
     refile to whatever the first target it finds is.  This is the
     default value because it most closely matches the behavior for
     version 1.x.  *THIS BEHAVIOR ALSO APPLIES TO INCUBATE REFILE
     TARGETS*. Therefore, if you have multiple incubated refile targets,
     you will need to set this variable to ‘nil’, or change to a single
     refile target.  You can e.g.  set a custom property to describe the
     kind of incubated item it is, if it is useful to you, something
     like:

          * Incubated
          ** Buy a boat
          SCHEDULED: <2035-06-01 Fri>
          :PROPERTIES:
          :INCUBATE: big financial investment
          :END:

   • Key bindings

     Version 1.x of Org GTD recommended a binding for
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-finalize’.  This binding must now be set as
     follows (replace the keybinding with one of your choice):

          (define-key org-gtd-process-map (kbd "C-c c") #'org-gtd-choose)

3.3.1 The easy way
------------------

Just turn on ‘org-gtd-mode’ (‘M-x org-gtd-mode’).  This will set up
emacs, Org mode, and Org GTD’s dependencies.  It will wrap a number of
‘org-agenda’ functions to work smoothly.  If you are just testing out
Org GTD, this is a good way to start.

   Turn off ‘org-gtd-mode’ to restore emacs to pre-org-gtd settings.

   Note, you should still head over to the *note Recommended key

   • I don’t care, just let me start using it

     The most direct way to find out about the configuration options for
     org-gtd is to see the customize group: ‘M-x customize-group RET
     org-gtd’.  They are all optional because they all come with default
     values.

     The only one you may want to change before starting to use Org GTD
     is ‘org-gtd-directory’, which is the directory that Org GTD will
     look to for everything it needs to do.

     The configuration options will also be mentioned in the relevant
     subsections of *note Using Org GTD::.

   • Tell me all the levers I can pull

     Make sure you also read about sub-package configuration: *note
     Required configuration of sub-packages::.

     ‘org-gtd-directory’
          set this to a directory.  ‘org-gtd’ will look for all its
          files in this directory.
     ‘org-gtd-next’
          Keyword to use for actions ready to be taken
     ‘org-gtd-next-suffix’
          org-mode keyword suffix (e.g.  !, @)
     ‘org-gtd-todo’
          Keyword to use for actions not yet ready
     ‘org-gtd-todo-suffix’
          org-mode keyword suffix (e.g.  !, @)
     ‘org-gtd-wait’
          Keyword to use for blocked actions (e.g.  delegated)
     ‘org-gtd-wait-suffix’
          org-mode keyword suffix (e.g.  !, @)
     ‘org-gtd-done’
          Keyword to use for completed actions
     ‘org-gtd-done-suffix’
          org-mode keyword suffix (e.g.  !, @)
     ‘org-gtd-canceled’
          Keyword to use for actions that won’t be done
     ‘org-gtd-canceled-suffix’
          org-mode keyword suffix (e.g.  !, @)
     ‘org-gtd-capture-templates’
          (!note: take care when changing this) This defines the
          pre-filled text that will show up when capturing an item to
          the inbox.  The only requirements are that the template string
          must define an org-mode top-level heading, and that the entry
          point to the inbox.  That is to say, the first two characters
          must be a single asterisk followed by a space: ‘"* "’, and the
          entry type must be like this: ‘entry (file
          ,#'org-gtd-inbox-path)’.  *note Adding things to the inbox::.
     ‘org-reverse-note-order’
          (‘org-mode’ variable) set this to ‘t’ to add new items to the
          top of project tasks and to ‘nil’ to add new items to the
          bottom of project tasks when organizing an item as such.
     ‘org-gtd-organize-hooks’
          this is a list of functions that you can use to decorate each
          item when you clarify it.  For instance, you could add a
          function to set the effort, or the priority, or some category,
          etc.  By default it has only one function, which lets you add
          tags, but of course you can change this entirely.  *note
          Organizing an item: Organizing an item into the system.
     ‘org-gtd-archive-location’
          Points to a function to generate the archive file dynamically.
          Default value generates a file suffixed with the current year.
          The function has an arity of zero and generates an org-mode
          file+outline path.  *note Cleaning up / archiving completed
          work::.
     ‘org-gtd-refile-to-any-target’
          when ‘t’, ‘org-gtd’ will refile to the first target it finds,
          and create a target if it doesn’t find one.  When false, it
          will ask for confirmation before refiling.  *note Refiling to
          the appropriate area::.
     ‘org-gtd-delegate-read-func’
          function that is used to prompt for a person a task is
          delegated to.  Must return a string.  By default this is set
          to ‘read-string’.
     ‘org-gtd-areas-of-focus’
          list of strings representing your areas of focus (horizon 2 in
          GTD).
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-show-horizons’
          When clarifying, do you want the horizons buffer to be shown
          by default, or do you prefer it hidden?
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-project-templates’
          Alist of strings: ‘project template name . project template’
          where there template is a series of tasks you may want to
          insert automatically, if you have a generic type of project
          that comes up a lot.
     ‘org-gtd-horizons-file’
          Name of the file, in ‘org-gtd-directory’, that will be
          displayed when the horizons buffer is displayed when
          clarifying.

3.3.4 Recommended key bindings
------------------------------

There’s an important keymap you’ll want to make the flow of processing
the inbox smoother.  To limit impact on your emacs configuration, there
is a specific keymap you can use.  The function you’ll want to bind is
‘org-gtd-organize’.  I suggest ‘C-c c’, as in the following example.

     (define-key org-gtd-clarify-map (kbd "C-c c") #'org-gtd-organize)

   For other keybindings, do what you need.  My bindings use ‘C-c d’ as
a prefix, i.e.:

‘C-c d c’
     ‘org-gtd-capture’
‘C-c d e’
     ‘org-gtd-engage’

   etc.

4.1 Org-mode building blocks for Org GTD
========================================

This section introduces how Org GTD leverages org-mode.

   Org Gtd uses ‘org-edna’ to automatically trigger state changes in
projects, such that when you mark a NEXT item from a project as DONE,
the next TODO in that project automatically becomes NEXT, such that the
agenda is always up-to-date (you may need to refresh the agenda).

   Org GTD uses org keywords to figure out the relevant state of each
task.  By default, ‘NEXT’, ‘TODO’, ‘WAIT’, ‘CNCL’, and ‘DONE’, though
you can configure them.

   Org GTD uses the following properties:
‘ORG_GTD’
     top-level property, used for simple filtering when it comes to
     agenda views
‘ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP’
     where the timestamp for appointments and other date-relevant
     actions is stored.  It’s separate from everything else org-mode
     related in order to allow you, the user, to use ‘SCHEDULED’,
     ‘DEADLINE’, or even plain timestamps as you see fit.

* Processing the inbox::
* Clarifying each item::
* Organizing an item into the system::
* Engaging with your GTD items::
* Working with the GTD Horizons::
* Cleaning up / archiving completed work::
* Commands you can call on org-agenda::
* Defining your own agenda views::
* Adding your own hooks when organizing::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Adding things to the inbox,  Next: Processing the inbox,  Up: The GTD flow

4.2.1 Adding things to the inbox
--------------------------------

The trip through GTD arguably begins by adding things to the inbox.  The
inbox is a file called ‘inbox.org’ in the directory stored in the
variable ‘org-gtd-directory’.  By default this means the file will be
‘~/gtd/inbox.org’.

   Org GTD provides one function to capture items: ‘M-x
org-gtd-capture’.  In my setup I have this bound globally as such:

     (global-set-key "C-c d c" #'org-gtd-capture)

   This function uses the variable ‘org-gtd-capture-templates’ to define
org-gtd-specific capture templates.  By default it comes with two
templates, one to just capture a new item, and one to capture an item
with a link to the file where you were when you started the capture.

   You can customize these templates as you see fit.  In order to
maintain proper functioning of org-gtd, however, there are two
constraints:

  1. the first two characters of the template string must be a single
     asterisk followed by a space: ‘"* "’
  2. the entry type must be like this: ‘entry (file
     ,#'org-gtd-inbox-path)’


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Processing the inbox,  Next: Clarifying each item,  Prev: Adding things to the inbox,  Up: The GTD flow

4.2.2 Processing the inbox
--------------------------

Processing the inbox means taking everything in the inbox, one at a
time, and refining/categorizing them so they are instantly useful when
you are looking at available next / scheduled actions.

   You can start processing the inbox with ‘org-gtd-process-inbox’.
This starts a looping behavior of clarifying each item in the inbox.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Clarifying each item,  Next: Organizing an item into the system,  Prev: Processing the inbox,  Up: The GTD flow

4.2.3 Clarifying each item
--------------------------

Clarifying an item means editing and adding the information that will be
most valuable to you to the item.  Note that task-specific information,
such as appointment date, or name of person to whom it is delegated, or
even area of focus, will be added during the Organize step, so don’t
worry about these yet.

   • How to start clarifying

     Besides ending up in here automatically while processing the inbox,
     there’s two more ways to enter the clarifying flow:

     ‘org-gtd-clarify-item’
          call this from any org-mode heading to do a one-off
          clarification.
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-agenda-item’
          call this from the agenda view, if you have anything you want
          to re-clarify, or possibly clarify for the first time, from
          somewhere outside the inbox.

   • data shape requirements

     There’s two general shapes you’ll be looking for.  Almost
     everything will look like a simple org-mode heading.  For instance,
     ‘* Task desc’.

     The only exception will be a project, that will look like a
     top-level heading for the project description with, underneath, a
     series of second-level headings representing each task to be
     executed sequentially before the project is complete.

          * Project heading
          ** First task
          ** Second task
          ** Third task

   • Options and commands related to clarification

     The clarify buffers are ‘org-mode’ buffers that use the minor mode
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-mode’.  There is a keymap, ‘org-gtd-clarify-map’,
     that you can use to bind useful

     While clarifying, you may find it useful to see your GTD horizons.
     You can use:
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-toggle-horizons-window’
          a function that toggles the display of the horizons buffer
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-show-horizons’
          a boolean variable defining whether the horizons window should
          be shown (t) or hidden (nil) by default when clarifying an
          item.  See *note Working with the GTD Horizons:: for more
          details.

     If you are clarifying a project, you may be interested in project
     templates:
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-project-insert-template’
          a function that will ask you to choose a template to insert.
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-project-templates’
          an alist of the form ‘(name . template)’ where both name and
          template are strings.  ‘name’ will be used in the interactive
          menu, and ‘template’ will be inserted in the buffer.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Organizing an item into the system,  Next: Engaging with your GTD items,  Prev: Clarifying each item,  Up: The GTD flow

4.2.4 Organizing an item into the system
----------------------------------------

When you are done clarifying, call ‘M-x org-gtd-organize’ (or hit your
keybinding for it, see *note Recommended key bindings::).  This will
open a transient menu to let you choose how Org GTD should categorize
this item.

   Organizing is broken up into three steps:
   • Choosing a task type
   • Applying hooks to add additional relevant information
   • Refiling to the appropriate area

   • Choosing a task type

     Here are the following task types you can choose.

     *[P]rojects
          This is a multi-step action.  In Org GTD, this is defined as a
          top-level org heading with a set of second-level org headings.
          Those second-level headings represent the sequentially-ordered
          set of tasks to be executed before the project can be called
          complete.
     *[A]dd to existing project
          Add current task to pre-existing project.  See
          ‘org-reverse-note-order’ to choose a default position (first
          or last) for this new task.  You can always adjust this
          yourself later, then put your point on the project heading and
          call ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords-for-project-at-point’
          to have Org GTD clean it up for you.
     *[C]alendar*
          Single action to be done at a given date or time.  Org GTD
          will ask you for a date/time for this appointment.
     *[D]elegate
          Let someone else do this.  Org GTD will ask you for a name to
          whom to delegate to and a date/time when to check up on the
          task with that person.  You can customize
          ‘org-gtd-delegate-read-func’ to specify a custom name input
          function (e.g.  for completion purposes).
     *[S]ingle action*
          This is a one-off to be done when possible.
     *[H]abit*
          org-mode-style habit.  Org GTD will ask you for a valid
          org-mode repeating stamp and a date when to start the habit
          tracking.  See the org-mode documentation for more
          information.
     *[I]ncubate*
          no action now; review later.  Org GTD will ask you for a date
          at which it should remind you about this.
     *[Q]uick action
          Less than 2 minutes.  Do it now, then choose this to mark the
          item as DONΕ and archive it.
     *[K]nowledge*
          This is knowledge to be stored away.  Choose this *after* you
          have properly saved this item as knowledge.
     *[T]rash*
          Not actionable; not knowledge.  Discard this item.

   • Applying hooks

     The decorations (priority, tags, categories, etc.)  are
     customizable as you desire and managed by ‘org-gtd-organize-hooks’,
     a list of functions.  You can add your own functions to this list,
     as long as the functions do not modify the text in any "custom"
     way, separate from what org-mode understands.

     See *note Adding your own hooks when organizing:: for more details
     on how you can add your own or customize this further.

   • Refiling to the appropriate area

     By default, org-gtd will refile to a single file in the directory,
     but you can create your own headings if you find it helpful.

     If you would like to add new refile targets, it’s simple, follow
     these instructions.

        • New project heading

          Add a top-level heading in any ‘.org’ file (including a new
          one) in ‘org-gtd-directory’ and make sure its property drawer
          matches the one in the constant ‘org-gtd-projects-template’.

        • Other headings

          Create a new top-level heading in any ‘.org’ file (including a
          new one) in ‘org-gtd-directory’ and make sure its property
          drawer matches the one in the relevant template constant:

             • ‘org-gtd-habit-template’
             • ‘org-gtd-calendar-template’
             • ‘org-gtd-incubate-template’
             • ‘org-gtd-action-template’

          Here is an example:

               :PROPERTIES:
               :ORG_GTD: Action
               :END:

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Working with the GTD Horizons,  Next: Cleaning up / archiving completed work,  Prev: Engaging with your GTD items,  Up: The GTD flow

4.2.6 Working with the GTD Horizons
-----------------------------------

In GTD, the horizons are defined as such:

Ground
     the day-to-day
Horizon 1
     projects
Horizon 2
     areas of focus
Horizon 3
     1-2 year goals
Horizon 4
     3-5 year vision
Horizon 5
     purpose and principles

   Obviously, Ground and Horizons 1 are handled by the
"capture/clarify/organize/engage" flow we’ve already seen.

   GTD recommends that you do not start using the horizons above Horizon
1 until you have both Ground and Horizon 1 under control.  So, when you
are ready...

   • Areas of focus

     Horizon 2 is now handled by a variable and a hook you can add to
     ‘org-gtd-organize-hooks’:
        • ‘org-gtd-areas-of-focus’ is a list of strings, each
          representing one of your areas of focus.
        • ‘org-gtd-set-area-of-focus’ is the hook you would add, e.g.
          ‘(setq org-gtd-organize-hooks '(org-gtd-set-area-of-focus))’,
          it ensures each item you clarify will need to be part of a
          horizon.

     You can then use the function ‘org-gtd-reflect-area-of-focus’ to
     generate an agenda view to review a specific area of focus.

     In order to add areas of focus to pre-existing items in your
     system, without going through the clarifying flow, we provide two
     functions:
        • ‘org-gtd-area-of-focus-set-on-item-at-point’, when you are on
          a org heading
        • ‘org-gtd-area-of-focus-set-on-agenda-item’, when you are on an
          agenda item

     Do note that calling the function on item at point will trust you
     blindly to do the right thing, whereas setting the area of focus
     through the agenda will attempt to recognize if you are on a
     project task and thus set the category on the project itself
     instead of the task.

   • Longer-term horizons

     The longer-term horizons can be stored in a file in the
     ‘org-gtd-directory’.  A variable governs the name of the file,
     ‘org-gtd-horizons-file’, by default ‘horizons.org’.

     At the moment it does not seem particularly useful to add any
     automation around these, since they will change so infrequently.

     They are, however, useful to display.

     A variable, ‘org-gtd-clarify-show-horizons’, determines
     whether/where to display the side buffer while clarifying.

     Regardless of the value of this variable, you can use the function
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-toggle-horizons-window’ to display or hide the
     side window.  If the above variable is nil, then the horizons
     window will be toggled on the right side of the screen.

4.2.7 Cleaning up / archiving completed work
--------------------------------------------

Doing this without user intervention is tricky, as it makes undoing
actions more complicated.  As such, Org GTD provides a function that
will go through the ‘org-gtd-directory’ files, find the headings that
belong to Org GTD (see *note Refiling to the appropriate area::), and
archive the finished items.

   The variable ‘org-gtd-archive-location’ points to a *function* that
returns a string matching the ‘org-archive-location’ definition.  It is
a function in order to allow the filename to be dynamic.

   The function to archive everything is ‘M-x
org-gtd-archive-completed-items’.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Commands you can call on org-agenda,  Next: Defining your own agenda views,  Prev: Cleaning up / archiving completed work,  Up: The GTD flow

4.2.8 Commands you can call on org-agenda
-----------------------------------------

Since Org provides the agenda, it is a convenient base of operations for
interacting with things that come up through ‘org-gtd-engage’.

   Here are the actions available to you:

‘M-x org-gtd-delegate-agenda-item’
     When the point is on an action, this will properly delegate the
     action to someone else.
‘M-x org-gtd-project-cancel-from-agenda’
     When the point is on a project action, this command will cancel the
     remaining actions in the project.
‘M-x org-gtd-clarify-agenda-item’
     If you would like to clarify and organize an item through the
     agenda view, for whatever reason, this is your entry point.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Defining your own agenda views,  Next: Adding your own hooks when organizing,  Prev: Commands you can call on org-agenda,  Up: The GTD flow

4.2.9 Defining your own agenda views
------------------------------------

You can define your own agenda views by defining your own functions like
shown below, where ‘x’ is whatever your defined key is.

     (defun my-agenda ()
       (with-org-gtd-context
           (let ((org-agenda-custom-commands '(your-definition-here)))
             (org-agenda nil "x"))))


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Adding your own hooks when organizing,  Prev: Defining your own agenda views,  Up: The GTD flow

4.2.10 Adding your own hooks when organizing
--------------------------------------------

Adding useful metadata to the tasks allows you to enhance the agenda
view to make it more useful to you, whether it be effort, tags,
priority, or any other amount of information you might like.

   This being said, different types of tasks or items are not even
created equal.  For instance, there may be metadata you want to add to a
project heading but not its tasks, or to a calendar item and not to a
trash item.

   Org GTD therefore provides a helper function,
‘org-gtd-organize-type-member-p’, which you can use when creating your
own hooks.  The function takes one argument, a list of types (provided
in the function’s documentation).  When called as part of a hook, this
function will check a buffer-local variable called
‘org-gtd--organize-type’, managed by Org GTD, to determine truthiness.

   For an example, see the source code for
‘org-gtd-areas-of-focus--set’, which will not run if the task being
organized is a project task, trash, knowledge, or a quick action.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Automating through emacs,  Prev: The GTD flow,  Up: Using Org GTD

4.3 Automating through emacs
============================

There’s now a few functions you can use when you are doing work within
emacs and would like GTD to track something for you as a result:
   • ‘org-gtd-habit-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-calendar-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-delegate-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-incubate-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-single-action-create’

   See the documentation for each, but suffice it to say they all take,
at the very least, a string that will be used as the text part of the
org heading that gets stored in org-gtd.

   For instance, one way this could work:

     (defun org-gtd-email-reminder ()
       (let ((topic (message-fetch-field "subject"))
             (delegated-to (message-fetch-field "to"))
             (reminder-date (org-read-date nil nil "+3d")))
         (org-gtd-delegate-create (format "Reminder: %s" topic)
                                  delegated-to
                                  reminder-date)))

     (add-hook 'message-send-hook 'org-gtd-email-reminder)
