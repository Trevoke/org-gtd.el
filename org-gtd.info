1 Summary
*********

This package tries to replicate as closely as possible the GTD workflow
(see diagram below).

   This package, and this documentation, assume familiarity with the
flow of GTD as described in the book.

   This package provides a system that allows you to capture incoming
things into an inbox, then process the inbox and categorize each item
based on the GTD categories.  It leverages org-agenda to show today's
items as well as the NEXT items.  It provides a flexible project
management system with support for both sequential and parallel task
execution.

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Flexible project dependencies (the big one!),  Next: Simplified keyword configuration,  Up: What's new in 40

2.1 Flexible project dependencies (the big one!)
================================================

Projects are no longer limited to sequential tasks!  You can now create
complex project structures with parallel tasks and custom dependencies.

   • *Define any dependency relationship* - Tasks can block other tasks,
     creating a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of dependencies
   • *Parallel work streams* - Multiple tasks can be NEXT at the same
     time if they don't depend on each other
   • *Automatic dependency detection* - Org GTD finds all tasks that are
     ready to work on based on the dependency graph
   • *Cycle prevention* - The system prevents circular dependencies that
     would create deadlocks
   • *Visual dependency helper* (optional) - See task relationships in a
     side window while clarifying projects

   Tasks without explicit dependencies still work sequentially (as
before), so your existing projects continue to work unchanged.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Simplified keyword configuration,  Next: Data-driven configuration,  Prev: Flexible project dependencies (the big one!),  Up: What's new in 40

2.2 Simplified keyword configuration
====================================

The new keyword configuration system is clearer and more maintainable:

   • *One mapping instead of many variables* - Replace individual
     keyword variables (‘org-gtd-next’, ‘org-gtd-todo’, etc.)  with a
     single ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’ structure
   • *Global TODO keywords* - No more file-level ‘#+TODO:’ lines that
     can conflict.  Use Emacs' global ‘org-todo-keywords’ configuration
     instead
   • *Automatic validation* - Org GTD validates your keyword
     configuration and provides helpful error messages if something is
     wrong
   • *Better Emacs 29+ support* - Use ‘setopt’ for automatic validation
     when setting variables

   See *note Configuration options: Tell me all the levers I can pull.
for details.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Data-driven configuration,  Next: Declarative view language,  Prev: Simplified keyword configuration,  Up: What's new in 40

2.3 Data-driven configuration
=============================

New configuration system allows you to customize item properties
declaratively:

   • *Configure by item type* - Define what properties each GTD item
     type should have
   • *Prompt for user input* - Automatically prompt for dates, text, or
     custom data when organizing
   • *Extensible* - Easy to add your own custom configuration for new
     item types


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Declarative view language,  Next: Better project modification,  Prev: Data-driven configuration,  Up: What's new in 40

2.4 Declarative view language
=============================

Creating custom agenda views is now much easier with a declarative
syntax:

   • *Specify what you want, not how to get it* - Define views using
     simple filters instead of complex skip functions
   • *Native org-agenda integration* - Uses org-agenda's built-in skip
     functions for performance
   • *More maintainable* - View definitions are data structures, not
     code


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Better project modification,  Next: Updated terminology Review → Reflect,  Prev: Declarative view language,  Up: What's new in 40

2.5 Better project modification
===============================

   • *Add tasks to projects anywhere* - You can now add tasks to
     projects even if the project file is outside ‘org-gtd-directory’
   • *Modify project structure* - Commands to create task dependencies
     and manage complex projects


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Updated terminology Review → Reflect,  Next: Updated terminology Incubate → Tickler + Someday/Maybe,  Prev: Better project modification,  Up: What's new in 40

2.6 Updated terminology: Review → Reflect
=========================================

Following David Allen's updated terminology from his more recent books,
all "review" and "oops" commands are now named "reflect":

   • ‘org-gtd-review-*’ → ‘org-gtd-reflect-*’
   • ‘org-gtd-oops-*’ → ‘org-gtd-reflect-*’

   The old names still work as aliases but are marked obsolete.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Updated terminology Incubate → Tickler + Someday/Maybe,  Next: Enhanced reflect capabilities,  Prev: Updated terminology Review → Reflect,  Up: What's new in 40

2.7 Updated terminology: Incubate → Tickler + Someday/Maybe
===========================================================

The "Incubate" category has been split into two distinct types to better
align with GTD concepts:

   • *Tickler* - Items with a specific review date (formerly
     "Incubated").  Use this for time-based reminders and paused
     projects with a date to revisit.
   • *Someday/Maybe* - Items with no specific timeframe.  Use this for
     ideas and possibilities you might pursue eventually.

   This clarifies the distinction between "remind me on a specific date"
(Tickler) and "maybe someday with no commitment" (Someday/Maybe).

   Changes:
   • ‘org-gtd-incubate’ → ‘org-gtd-tickler’ (creates tickler items with
     timestamps)
   • New ‘org-gtd-someday’ command (creates someday items without
     timestamps)
   • New ‘org-gtd-reflect-someday-review’ command - Walk through someday
     items one-by-one with single-keystroke defer/clarify/quit actions.
     Optionally group items into named lists for focused reviews.  See
     *note Reviewing Someday/Maybe Items::.
   • Property value: ‘ORG_GTD: Incubated’ → ‘ORG_GTD: Tickler’ or
     ‘ORG_GTD: Someday’

   The old ‘org-gtd-incubate’ command still works as an alias to
‘org-gtd-tickler’ but is marked obsolete.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Enhanced reflect capabilities,  Next: Simplified configuration,  Prev: Updated terminology Incubate → Tickler + Someday/Maybe,  Up: What's new in 40

2.8 Enhanced reflect capabilities
=================================

   • *Find missed items* - New ‘org-gtd-reflect-missed-items’ command to
     catch things that slipped through
   • *Better stuck project detection* - Improved identification of
     projects that need attention


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Simplified configuration,  Next: Per-type refile prompting,  Prev: Enhanced reflect capabilities,  Up: What's new in 40

2.9 Simplified configuration
============================

   • *org-gtd-mode has a new purpose* - The mode is no longer about
     wrapping agenda commands.  It now provides a mode-line indicator
     showing your inbox count (e.g., ‘GTD[5]’), giving you at-a-glance
     visibility into how many items need processing.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Per-type refile prompting,  Next: Capture timestamps,  Prev: Simplified configuration,  Up: What's new in 40

2.10 Per-type refile prompting
==============================

You can now control refile prompting behavior for each GTD item type
independently:

   • *Fine-grained control* - Configure which item types prompt for
     refile target selection vs.  auto-refile to first target
   • *Sensible defaults* - Most item types prompt by default; quick
     actions, knowledge, and trash auto-refile
   • *Deprecates ‘org-gtd-refile-to-any-target’* - The old boolean is
     replaced by ‘org-gtd-refile-prompt-for-types’, a list of types that
     should prompt

   See *note Refiling to the appropriate area:: for configuration
details.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Capture timestamps,  Next: What you need to do,  Prev: Per-type refile prompting,  Up: What's new in 40

2.11 Capture timestamps
=======================

Captured items now automatically receive an ‘ORG_GTD_CAPTURED_AT’
property with an inactive timestamp recording when the item was
captured.  This is useful for:

   • *Inbox reviews* - See how long items have been sitting in your
     inbox
   • *Weekly reviews* - Identify items that have been captured but not
     processed
   • *Auditing* - Track when ideas and tasks entered your system

   This happens automatically for all captures using the default
templates.  No configuration needed.

2.12 What you need to do
========================

If you're upgrading from 3.x, see the *note Upgrading section:
Upgrading. for complete step-by-step instructions.  The required changes
are:

  1. Update your keyword configuration to use ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’
  2. Remove any ‘#+TODO:’ lines from your GTD files
  3. *Run the migration: ‘M-x org-gtd-upgrade-v3-to-v4’* (required for
     projects to work!)

   For new installations, just configure ‘org-todo-keywords’ and
‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’ and you're ready to go.

Version 4.0 introduces major improvements to keyword configuration and
project management.  Your existing GTD data will continue to work, but
you'll need to update your configuration and optionally migrate to take
full advantage of new features.

   • Required: Configuration changes

     *1.  Update keyword configuration*

     *OLD way (version 3.x):*
          ;; Individual keyword variables (no longer used)
          (setq org-gtd-next "NEXT")
          (setq org-gtd-todo "TODO")
          (setq org-gtd-wait "WAIT")
          (setq org-gtd-canceled "CNCL")

     *NEW way (version 4.0):*
          ;; First, configure org-mode's global TODO keywords
          ;; All your GTD keywords must be in the same sequence
          (setq org-todo-keywords
                '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))

          ;; Then map GTD semantic states to your keywords
          ;; Use setopt (Emacs 29+) for automatic validation, or setq for older versions
          (setopt org-gtd-keyword-mapping
                  '((todo . "TODO")      ;; tasks not ready to be acted upon
                    (next . "NEXT")      ;; tasks ready to act on immediately
                    (wait . "WAIT")      ;; tasks blocked or delegated
                    (done . "DONE")      ;; tasks successfully completed
                    (canceled . "CNCL"))) ;; tasks that won't be completed

     Steps:
       1. Remove old keyword variables (‘org-gtd-next’, ‘org-gtd-todo’,
          ‘org-gtd-wait’, ‘org-gtd-canceled’ and their ‘-suffix’
          variants) from your configuration
       2. Remove any ‘#+TODO:’ lines from your GTD org files (inbox.org,
          org-gtd-tasks.org, etc.)
       3. Add the global keyword configuration to your Emacs init file
       4. Ensure all GTD keywords appear in the *same sequence* in
          ‘org-todo-keywords’

   • Required: Configure org-agenda-files

     Before running the migration, ensure your GTD files are in
     ‘org-agenda-files’.  The migration command scans these files to
     find items to upgrade.

     For the migration to work, first load org-gtd, then set
     ‘org-agenda-files’:

          (require 'org-gtd)
          (setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))

     Or if using ‘use-package’, put the ‘org-agenda-files’ setting in
     your ‘:config’ section.  It's important to put the
     ‘org-gtd-directory’ definition in the ‘:init’ section.

     If ‘org-agenda-files’ is not configured, the migration won't find
     anything to migrate.

   • Required: Data migration

     Version 4.0 changes how projects work internally.  *The old
     TRIGGER-based system no longer functions* - v4 uses dependency
     properties instead.  You MUST run the migration for your existing
     projects to continue working.

     *Make a backup first!*  The migration modifies your GTD files.

     *Run the migration command:*

          M-x org-gtd-upgrade-v3-to-v4

     *What the migration does:*

     The migration performs five steps automatically:

       1. *Migrates Incubated items* to Tickler or Someday:
             • Items with ‘ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP’: Sets ‘ORG_GTD="Tickler"’
             • Items without timestamp: Sets ‘ORG_GTD="Someday"’
             • Level 1 heading gets ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE’ based on first
               child's type

       2. *Adds ORG_GTD properties* to identify items:
             • Adds ‘ORG_GTD="Projects"’ to project headings
             • Adds ‘ORG_GTD="Actions"’ to project tasks

       3. *Migrates delegated items* to use their own type:
             • Changes ‘ORG_GTD’ from "Actions" to "Delegated" for items
               with ‘DELEGATED_TO’ property
             • This separates delegated items from regular single
               actions

       4. *Migrates habits* to use consistent property value:
             • Sets ‘ORG_GTD="Habit"’ on all items with ‘STYLE="habit"’

       5. *Converts projects to dependency-based system*:
             • Adds ‘ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON’ and ‘ORG_GTD_BLOCKS’ properties
               to create sequential task chains
             • Adds ‘ORG_GTD_FIRST_TASKS’ property to project headings
             • Updates task states (NEXT/TODO) based on the new
               dependency graph

     *After migration:*

        • Your projects continue to work sequentially (task 1 → task 2 →
          task 3)
        • The sequential behavior is now implemented via dependency
          properties instead of TRIGGER
        • You can now customize dependencies for individual projects if
          you want parallel tasks
        • Safe to run multiple times if needed

   • Required: Acknowledge the upgrade

     After completing the upgrade, you must set ‘org-gtd-update-ack’ to
     suppress the upgrade warning.  *This setting must be evaluated
     before org-gtd loads*—otherwise the warning appears during package
     loading, before your config runs.

     *Why before loading?*  The warning is intentionally triggered at
     load time so you can't miss it.  Once you've completed the upgrade
     steps, you acknowledge by setting this variable in the ':init'
     section (for use-package) or before the ‘require’ statement.

     *use-package:*
          (use-package org-gtd
            :after org
            :init
            ;; Acknowledge upgrade BEFORE package loads
            (setq org-gtd-update-ack "4.0.0")
            :config
            ;; Rest of your configuration...
            (org-edna-mode 1))

     *Without use-package:*
          ;; Set BEFORE requiring org-gtd
          (setq org-gtd-update-ack "4.0.0")
          (require 'org-gtd)

     *What version to use:* Always set it to the major version you've
     upgraded to (e.g., "4.0.0").  Minor version updates (4.0.1, 4.1.0)
     generally don't require acknowledgment—only major upgrades with
     breaking changes do.

   • Why these changes?

     *Keyword configuration:*
        • Simpler: One mapping structure instead of multiple variables
        • More reliable: Global configuration avoids file-level
          conflicts
        • Better validation: Org GTD checks your configuration and
          provides helpful errors
        • Future-proof: Easier to extend with new keyword types

     *Property-based system:*
        • More robust: Properties work reliably across different
          org-mode features
        • More flexible: Enables features like multi-project tasks
        • Better performance: Efficient skip functions for native
          org-agenda

   • org-gtd-mode has a new purpose

     The ‘org-gtd-mode’ minor mode has been redesigned in version 4.0.
     It no longer wraps org-agenda commands—instead, it provides useful
     mode-line feedback.

     *What it does now:*
        • Displays inbox count in your mode-line (e.g., ‘GTD[5]’)
        • Includes items from both main inbox and additional inbox files
        • Refreshes periodically to catch external file changes

     *To enable:*
          (org-gtd-mode 1)

   • org-agenda-property has been vendored

     If you were using ‘org-agenda-property’ configuration variables to
     show properties in the agenda, you need to update them.  The
     package has been vendored into org-gtd with a new prefix.

     *OLD (org-agenda-property package):*
          (setq org-agenda-property-list '("LOCATION" "DELEGATED_TO"))
          (setq org-agenda-property-position 'where-it-fits)
          (setq org-agenda-property-column 60)
          (setq org-agenda-property-separator "|")

     *NEW (org-gtd-agenda-property):*
          (setq org-gtd-agenda-property-list '("LOCATION" "DELEGATED_TO"))
          (setq org-gtd-agenda-property-position 'where-it-fits)
          (setq org-gtd-agenda-property-column 60)
          (setq org-gtd-agenda-property-separator "|")

     Steps:
       1. Remove ‘org-agenda-property’ from your package dependencies
          (no longer needed)
       2. Rename any ‘org-agenda-property-*’ variables to
          ‘org-gtd-agenda-property-*’

     The functionality is identical—only the naming has changed.

3.3.1 Basic setup
-----------------

You need to configure three things for org-gtd to work:

  1. *TODO keywords*: Configure ‘org-todo-keywords’ with your GTD
     workflow states
  2. *Keyword mapping*: Map GTD semantic states to your keywords with
     ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’
  3. *org-edna*: Enable org-edna with inheritance for project
     dependencies to work

   *Important for existing org-mode users*: If you already have custom
‘org-todo-keywords’, add a separate sequence for GTD keywords rather
than mixing them into your existing sequences.  See *note Required
keyword configuration:: for details.

   See the configuration sections below for details.

   *Optional*: Enable ‘org-gtd-mode’ if you want to see your inbox count
in the mode-line (e.g., ‘GTD[5]’).

3.3.2 Complete Configuration Examples
-------------------------------------

*Configuration is the most critical part of setup.*  The examples below
are complete, working configurations you can copy-paste into your init
file.

   • Example 1: Vanilla Emacs (Minimal Configuration)

     This is the simplest possible configuration for org-gtd.  Copy this
     entire block into your init file:

          ;; Suppress upgrade warnings (set BEFORE org-gtd loads)
          ;; After upgrading, set to the version you upgraded to
          (setq org-gtd-update-ack "4.0.0")

          ;; Configure org-mode TODO keywords
          ;; All GTD keywords MUST be in the same sequence
          ;; Standard options like "TODO(t)" or "DONE(d!)" are fine - org-gtd ignores them
          (setq org-todo-keywords
                '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))

          ;; Map GTD semantic states to your keywords
          (setq org-gtd-keyword-mapping
                '((todo . "TODO")      ; tasks not ready to act on
                  (next . "NEXT")      ; tasks ready to act on immediately
                  (wait . "WAIT")      ; tasks blocked or delegated
                  (done . "DONE")      ; tasks successfully completed
                  (canceled . "CNCL"))) ; tasks that won't be completed

          ;; Optional: Set GTD directory (defaults to ~/gtd/)
          ;; Must be set BEFORE org-gtd loads if you want to customize it
          ;; (setq org-gtd-directory "~/my-gtd/")

          ;; Enable per-type refile prompting (recommended)
          ;; Without this, all items auto-refile to first target without prompting
          (setq org-gtd-refile-to-any-target nil)
          ;; Customize which types prompt vs auto-refile:
          ;; (setq org-gtd-refile-prompt-for-types '(project-heading project-task ...))

          ;; REQUIRED: Enable org-edna for project dependencies
          (org-edna-mode 1)

          ;; Global keybindings for GTD commands
          ;; These work anywhere in Emacs
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d c") 'org-gtd-capture)
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d e") 'org-gtd-engage)
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d p") 'org-gtd-process-inbox)
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d n") 'org-gtd-show-all-next)
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d s") 'org-gtd-reflect-stuck-projects)



          ;; Keybinding for clarify map and agenda files
          ;; These only work after org-gtd loads (e.g. so org-gtd-directory is defined)
          (with-eval-after-load 'org-gtd
            (setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))
            (define-key org-gtd-clarify-mode-map (kbd "C-c c") 'org-gtd-organize))

          ;; Quick task actions in agenda view
          (with-eval-after-load 'org-agenda
            (define-key org-agenda-mode-map (kbd "C-c .") 'org-gtd-agenda-transient))

   • Example 2: Doom Emacs Configuration

     If you use Doom Emacs, add this to your ‘packages.el’:

          (package! org-gtd)

     Then add this to your ‘config.el’:

          (use-package! org-gtd
            :after org
            :init
            ;; Suppress upgrade warnings (must be set before package loads)
            (setq org-gtd-update-ack "4.0.0")
            ;; Set GTD directory before package loads
            (setq org-gtd-directory "~/gtd/")

            :custom
            (org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))
            (org-gtd-keyword-mapping '((todo . "TODO")
                                       (next . "NEXT")
                                       (wait . "WAIT")
                                       (done . "DONE")
                                       (canceled . "CNCL")))
            ;; Enable per-type refile prompting (recommended)
            ;; Without this, all items auto-refile to first target without prompting
            (org-gtd-refile-to-any-target nil)

            :config
            (org-edna-mode)
            ;; Add org-gtd files to your agenda (in :config so org-gtd-directory is defined)
            (setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))
            ;; Doom-style leader key bindings
            (map! :leader
                  (:prefix ("d" . "org-gtd")
                   :desc "Capture"        "c"  #'org-gtd-capture
                   :desc "Engage"         "e"  #'org-gtd-engage

                  :desc "GTD quick actions" "C-c ." #'org-gtd-agenda-transient))

   • Example 3: Spacemacs Configuration

     If you use Spacemacs, add this to your ‘dotspacemacs/user-config’
     function:

          ;; Install org-gtd
          (use-package org-gtd
            :ensure t
            :after org
            :init
            ;; Suppress upgrade warnings (must be set before package loads)
            (setq org-gtd-update-ack "4.0.0")
            ;; Configure org-mode TODO keywords
            (setq org-todo-keywords
                  '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))
            ;; Map GTD semantic states
            (setq org-gtd-keyword-mapping
                  '((todo . "TODO")
                    (next . "NEXT")
                    (wait . "WAIT")
                    (done . "DONE")
                    (canceled . "CNCL")))
            ;; Set GTD directory before package loads
            (setq org-gtd-directory "~/gtd/")
            ;; Enable per-type refile prompting (recommended)
            ;; Without this, all items auto-refile to first target without prompting
            (setq org-gtd-refile-to-any-target nil)

            :config
            ;; REQUIRED: Enable org-edna for project dependencies
            (org-edna-mode 1)
            ;; Add org-gtd files to your agenda (in :config so org-gtd-directory is defined)
            (setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))
            ;; Spacemacs leader key bindings
            (spacemacs/set-leader-keys
              "od c" 'org-gtd-capture
              "od e" 'org-gtd-engage
              "od p" 'org-gtd-process-inbox
              "od n" 'org-gtd-show-all-next
              "od s" 'org-gtd-reflect-stuck-projects)
            ;; Clarify map binding
            (with-eval-after-load 'org-gtd
              (define-key org-gtd-clarify-mode-map (kbd "C-c c") 'org-gtd-organize))
            ;; Quick task actions in agenda view
            (with-eval-after-load 'org-agenda
              (define-key org-agenda-mode-map (kbd "C-c .") 'org-gtd-agenda-transient)))

   • What These Configurations Do

     All three examples configure the same essential pieces:

       1. *‘org-todo-keywords’* - Defines the workflow states (TODO →
          NEXT → WAIT → DONE/CNCL)
             • The ‘|’ separator marks done states (right side) vs
               active states (left side)
             • All GTD keywords must be in a single sequence

       2. *‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’* - Maps GTD concepts to your
          keyword choices
             • ‘todo’ - Tasks not yet actionable
             • ‘next’ - Tasks ready to work on right now
             • ‘wait’ - Tasks blocked or delegated
             • ‘done’ - Tasks successfully completed
             • ‘canceled’ - Tasks that won't be done

       3. *‘org-gtd-directory’* - Where org-gtd keeps its files
          (defaults to ‘~/gtd/’)

       4. *‘org-agenda-files’* - Makes org-gtd items appear in agenda
          views

       5. *‘org-edna-mode’* - REQUIRED for projects to work

       6. *Keybindings* - Three types:
             • *Global bindings*: Work anywhere in Emacs (capture,
               engage, process, etc.)
             • *Clarify map binding*: Only works when organizing items
               in clarify buffers
             • *Agenda map binding*: Quick task actions in agenda views
               (‘C-c .’ for ‘org-gtd-agenda-transient’)

   • Testing Your Configuration

     After adding one of the configurations above and restarting Emacs,
     verify everything works:

     *Test 1: Capture works*

          M-x org-gtd-capture

     Expected: Opens a capture buffer for the inbox.

     If it fails: Check that ‘org-gtd-directory’ exists and you have
     write permissions.

     *Test 2: Engage works*

          M-x org-gtd-engage

     Expected: Opens an agenda view (might be empty if you haven't
     organized anything yet).

     If it fails: Check that ‘org-agenda-files’ includes your GTD
     directory.

     *Test 3: Keywords are recognized*

       1. Open any org file: ‘M-x find-file ~/test.org’
       2. Type: ‘* Test heading’
       3. Put cursor on the heading
       4. Try cycling TODO states: ‘C-c C-t’

     Expected: Should cycle through TODO → NEXT → WAIT → DONE → CNCL.

     If it fails: Check that ‘org-todo-keywords’ is set correctly.

     *Test 4: org-edna is enabled*

          M-x describe-variable RET org-edna-mode

     Expected: Should show "t" (enabled).

     If it fails: Make sure ‘(org-edna-mode 1)’ is in your config and
     you've restarted Emacs.

   • Common Configuration Problems

     Before troubleshooting, identify which configuration style you're
     using:
        • *Vanilla Emacs*: See *note Example 1 Vanilla Emacs: Example 1
          Vanilla Emacs (Minimal Configuration).
        • *Doom Emacs*: See *note Example 2 Doom Emacs: Example 2 Doom
          Emacs Configuration.
        • *Spacemacs*: See *note Example 3 Spacemacs: Example 3
          Spacemacs Configuration.

     Each example shows the complete, correct configuration for that
     environment.

     *Problem: "org-gtd-capture" is undefined*

     *Cause*: org-gtd package isn't installed or loaded.

     *Solution*:
        • *Vanilla Emacs*: Install from MELPA with ‘M-x package-install
          RET org-gtd RET’
        • *Doom Emacs*: Add ‘(package! org-gtd)’ to your ‘packages.el’
          and run ‘doom sync’
        • *Spacemacs*: The ‘use-package’ form in the *note Spacemacs
          example: Example 3 Spacemacs Configuration. automatically
          installs it with ‘:ensure t’

     *Problem: Keywords don't change when I press C-c C-t*

     *Cause*: ‘org-todo-keywords’ not configured correctly.

     *Solution*: Check your configuration has this setting:
          (setq org-todo-keywords
                '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))

     Common mistakes:
        • Keywords not in quotes: Should be ‘"TODO"’ not ‘TODO’
        • Missing sequence wrapper: Need ‘'((sequence ...))’ not just
          ‘'("TODO" ...)’
        • No done separator: Need ‘|’ before ‘"DONE"’ and ‘"CNCL"’

     See the complete configuration for your environment above.

     *Problem: Projects don't advance when I mark tasks DONE*

     *Cause*: org-edna isn't enabled.

     *Solution*: All three configuration examples include
     ‘(org-edna-mode 1)’.  Make sure you have:
        • *Vanilla/Spacemacs*: ‘(org-edna-mode 1)’ in the ‘:config’
          section
        • *Doom*: ‘(org-edna-mode)’ in the ‘:config’ section (Doom
          handles the argument)

     *Problem: Can't see GTD items in agenda*

     *Cause*: GTD directory not in ‘org-agenda-files’.

     *Solution*: All three configuration examples include this.  Check
     you have:
          ;; For plain elisp - must be AFTER org-gtd loads
          (with-eval-after-load 'org-gtd
            (setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory)))

     Or if using ‘use-package’ / ‘use-package!’, put it in ‘:config’
     (not ‘:custom’):
          :config
          (setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))

     *Problem: Keybindings don't work*

     *Cause*: Keybindings not defined, or defined incorrectly for your
     environment.

     *Solution*:
        • *Vanilla Emacs*: Use ‘global-set-key’ for global commands,
          ‘define-key org-gtd-clarify-mode-map’ for clarify buffer
          commands
        • *Doom Emacs*: Use ‘map!’ with ‘:leader’ prefix for global,
          ‘:map org-gtd-clarify-mode-map’ for clarify buffer
        • *Spacemacs*: Use ‘spacemacs/set-leader-keys’ for global,
          ‘define-key’ for clarify buffer

     The clarify binding (‘C-c c’) *only works in clarify buffers* - you
     must run ‘M-x org-gtd-process-inbox’ first.

     See the complete configuration for your environment to copy the
     correct keybinding syntax.

   • Working with Your Existing Org Setup

     Already have org-mode configured with your own refile targets and
     archive location?  Org-gtd is designed to work *alongside* your
     existing setup, not replace it.

     *Quick answers:*

        • *Will org-gtd break my ‘org-refile-targets’?*  No.  Org-gtd
          merges its targets with yours.  Your targets appear first in
          completion.

        • *Will org-gtd ignore my ‘org-archive-location’?*  By default,
          yes—org-gtd uses year-based archive files.  But you can make
          it respect yours with one line:
               (setq org-gtd-archive-location nil)  ; Use your org-archive-location

     *How the merge works:*

     When you organize an item (say, as a Project), org-gtd builds a
     combined refile target list:

       1. Your ‘org-refile-targets’ (appears first)
       2. Any heading with ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE: Projects’ property
          (org-gtd's system)

     So if you have ‘org-refile-targets’ pointing to
     ‘~/org/projects.org’, that file's headings appear first.  Org-gtd's
     property-marked targets appear after.

     *When to use which:*

     Scenario                       What to do
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     New to org-mode                Use org-gtd defaults.  It creates targets automatically.
     Have existing refile setup     Keep it!  Org-gtd adds to it, doesn't replace it.
     Want single archive file       Set ‘org-gtd-archive-location’ to ‘nil’, configure ‘org-archive-location’
     Want year-based GTD archives   Use org-gtd default (nothing to configure)

     *See also:* *note Refiling to the appropriate area:: for details on
     ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE’ properties, *note Cleaning up / archiving:
     Cleaning up / archiving completed work. for archive details.

3.3.3 Understanding Keybindings
-------------------------------

org-gtd uses two types of keybindings, and understanding the difference
is important:

   • Global Keybindings

     These work *anywhere* in Emacs and let you access the main GTD
     commands:

          ;; These commands are always available:
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d c") 'org-gtd-capture)       ; Capture to inbox
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d e") 'org-gtd-engage)        ; Daily view
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d p") 'org-gtd-process-inbox) ; Process inbox
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d n") 'org-gtd-show-all-next) ; Show NEXT actions

     You can use any key combination you prefer.  The ‘C-c d’ prefix is
     just a convention.

   • Clarify Map Keybindings

     These only work when you're in a *clarify buffer* (during inbox
     processing).  The most important one is:

          ;; This only works in clarify buffers:
          (define-key org-gtd-clarify-mode-map (kbd "C-c c") 'org-gtd-organize)

     *When you're in a clarify buffer:*
       1. You've called ‘org-gtd-process-inbox’ and are looking at an
          item
       2. You've edited the item to make it clear and actionable
       3. Now you press ‘C-c c’ to organize it (choose its type:
          project, single action, etc.)

     *Why the distinction?*

     The clarify map is a separate keymap because:
        • It prevents conflicts with other org-mode bindings
        • It only activates when you need it (during processing)
        • You can bind different keys for organizing without affecting
          the rest of Emacs

     *Common patterns:*

     Most users bind:
        • ‘C-c d *’ for global commands (capture, engage, process)
        • ‘C-c c’ for organizing (only in clarify buffers)

     But you can use whatever works for your workflow!


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Required configuration of sub-packages,  Next: configuration options for org-gtd,  Prev: Understanding Keybindings,  Up: Configuring

3.3.4 Required configuration of sub-packages
--------------------------------------------

   • Configuring org-edna

     package: <https://www.nongnu.org/org-edna-el/>

     This configuration is *REQUIRED* for project dependencies to work
     correctly.  It enables org-edna to automatically update task states
     when you complete tasks in a project.

          (org-edna-mode 1)

   • Adding org-gtd files to your agenda

     To see org-gtd items in your agenda views, add the org-gtd
     directory to your ‘org-agenda-files’.

     *Important*: This must happen AFTER org-gtd loads, so that
     ‘org-gtd-directory’ is defined:

          ;; For plain elisp configs:
          (with-eval-after-load 'org-gtd
            ;; If you only want GTD files in your agenda:
            (setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))
            ;; Or if you have other agenda files, add GTD to the list:
            ;; (add-to-list 'org-agenda-files org-gtd-directory)
            )

     For ‘use-package’ configs, put this in the ‘:config’ section (not
     ‘:custom’) so it runs after the package loads.

3.3.5 configuration options for org-gtd
---------------------------------------

   • I don't care, just let me start using it

     The most direct way to find out about the configuration options for
     org-gtd is to see the customize group: ‘M-x customize-group RET
     org-gtd’.  They are all optional because they all come with default
     values.

     The only one you may want to change before starting to use Org GTD
     is ‘org-gtd-directory’, which is the directory that Org GTD will
     look to for everything it needs to do.

     The configuration options will also be mentioned in the relevant
     subsections of *note Using Org GTD::.

   • Tell me all the levers I can pull

     Make sure you also read about sub-package configuration: *note
     Required configuration of sub-packages::.

        • Required keyword configuration

          These settings are *required* for Org GTD to work properly:

          ‘org-todo-keywords’
               (‘org-mode’ variable) Define your TODO keyword sequences
               here.  All GTD keywords (TODO, NEXT, WAIT, DONE, CNCL or
               your custom versions) *must* be in the same sequence.
               Example:
                    (setq org-todo-keywords
                          '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))

               *Power users note:* If you already have
               ‘org-todo-keywords’ configured with your own workflows
               (e.g., BACKLOG, DOING, REVIEW), don't merge GTD keywords
               into those sequences.  Instead, add a *separate* GTD
               sequence.  Your org-gtd items could end up in an
               unhandled state otherwise (always fixable, but annoying).
               Example with multiple sequences:
                    (setq org-todo-keywords
                          '((sequence "BACKLOG(b)" "DOING(o)" "REVIEW(r)" "|" "DONE(d)" "ARCHIVED(a)")
                            (sequence "TODO(t)" "NEXT(n)" "WAIT(w)" "|" "DONE(D)" "CNCL(c)")))  ; GTD

          ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’
               Map GTD semantic states to your chosen keywords.  This
               tells Org GTD which keyword means what.  The five
               required mappings are.
               ‘todo’
                    Tasks not ready to be acted upon
               ‘next’
                    Tasks ready to act on immediately
               ‘wait’
                    Tasks blocked or delegated to someone else
               ‘done’
                    Tasks successfully completed
               ‘canceled’
                    Tasks that won't be completed

               Example configuration (use ‘setopt’ for Emacs 29+ to get
               automatic validation):
                    (setopt org-gtd-keyword-mapping
                            '((todo . "TODO")
                              (next . "NEXT")
                              (wait . "WAIT")
                              (done . "DONE")
                              (canceled . "CNCL")))

               Or for older Emacs versions:
                    (setq org-gtd-keyword-mapping
                          '((todo . "TODO")
                            (next . "NEXT")
                            (wait . "WAIT")
                            (done . "DONE")
                            (canceled . "CNCL")))

        • Optional configuration

          ‘org-gtd-directory’
               set this to a directory.  ‘org-gtd’ will look for all its
               files in this directory.
          ‘org-gtd-capture-templates’
               (!note: take care when changing this) This defines the
               pre-filled text that will show up when capturing an item
               to the inbox.  The only requirements are that the
               template string must define an org-mode top-level
               heading, and that the entry point to the inbox.  That is
               to say, the first two characters must be a single
               asterisk followed by a space: ‘"* "’, and the entry type
               must be like this: ‘entry (file ,#'org-gtd-inbox-path)’.
               *note Adding things to the inbox::.
          ‘org-reverse-note-order’
               (‘org-mode’ variable) set this to ‘t’ to add new items to
               the top of project tasks and to ‘nil’ to add new items to
               the bottom of project tasks when organizing an item as
               such.
          ‘org-gtd-organize-hooks’
               this is a list of functions that you can use to decorate
               each item when you clarify it.  For instance, you could
               add a function to set the effort, or the priority, or
               some category, etc.  By default it has only one function,
               which lets you add tags, but of course you can change
               this entirely.  *note Organizing an item: Organizing an
               item into the system.
          ‘org-gtd-archive-location’
               Points to a function to generate the archive file
               dynamically.  Default value generates a file suffixed
               with the current year.  The function has an arity of zero
               and generates an org-mode file+outline path.  *note
               Cleaning up / archiving completed work::.
          ‘org-gtd-refile-prompt-for-types’
               list of GTD item types that should prompt for refile
               target selection.  Types not in the list auto-refile to
               first target.  Requires ‘org-gtd-refile-to-any-target’ to
               be ‘nil’.  *note Controlling Refile Prompts by Item
               Type::.
          ‘org-gtd-delegate-read-func’
               function that is used to prompt for a person a task is
               delegated to.  Must return a string.  By default this is
               set to ‘read-string’.
          ‘org-gtd-areas-of-focus’
               list of strings representing your areas of focus (horizon
               2 in GTD).
          ‘org-gtd-clarify-show-horizons’
               When clarifying, do you want the horizons buffer to be
               shown by default, or do you prefer it hidden?
          ‘org-gtd-clarify-show-organize-help’
               When clarifying, show a help buffer with GTD item type
               descriptions and keyboard shortcuts.
          ‘org-gtd-clarify-project-templates’
               Alist of strings: ‘project template name . project
               template’ where there template is a series of tasks you
               may want to insert automatically, if you have a generic
               type of project that comes up a lot.
          ‘org-gtd-clarify-display-helper-buffer’
               When ‘t’, show a dependencies helper window when
               clarifying projects with multiple tasks.  Useful for
               visualizing task relationships.
          ‘org-gtd-horizons-file’
               Name of the file, in ‘org-gtd-directory’, that will be
               displayed when the horizons buffer is displayed when
               clarifying.
          ‘org-gtd-prefix-width’
               how many characters to dedicate to the prefix, on the
               left side of the TODO items, so the project name, area of
               focus, or other context can show clearly.  See *note
               Prefix DSL: Prefix DSL Customizing the Task Prefix
               Column. for controlling what appears in the prefix.
          ‘org-gtd-agenda-property-list’
               List of properties to display in agenda views (default:
               ‘'("LOCATION")’).  See *note Configuration Variables
               Reference:: for related positioning options.
          ‘org-gtd-graph-render-mode’
               Default rendering mode for project graphs (‘'svg’ or
               ‘'ascii’).  Terminal users should use ‘'ascii’.  *note
               Graph Rendering Modes::.
          ‘org-gtd-graph-ui-split-ratio’
               Width ratio for graph vs.  details panel (default: ‘0.7’
               = 70% graph).
          ‘org-gtd-save-after-organize’
               When ‘t’, save all modified buffers after each organize
               step.

3.3.6 Recommended key bindings
------------------------------

There's an important keymap you'll want to make the flow of processing
the inbox smoother.  To limit impact on your emacs configuration, there
is a specific keymap you can use.  The function you'll want to bind is
‘org-gtd-organize’.  I suggest ‘C-c c’, as in the following example.

     (define-key org-gtd-clarify-mode-map (kbd "C-c c") #'org-gtd-organize)

   For other keybindings, do what you need.  My bindings use ‘C-c d’ as
a prefix, i.e.:

‘C-c d c’
     ‘org-gtd-capture’
‘C-c d e’
     ‘org-gtd-engage’

   etc.

   • Command Center

     Alternatively, you can bind a single key to
     ‘org-gtd-command-center’, which provides a transient menu with
     access to all major org-gtd commands:

          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d") #'org-gtd-command-center)

     The command center is organized for both discovery and quick
     access:

     *Engage* (‘e’, ‘@’, ‘n’)
          What to work on now
     *Capture & Process* (‘c’, ‘p’, ‘k’)
          Add items and process inbox
     *Reflect* (‘a’, ‘y’, ‘d’, ‘r’, ‘R’)
          Review areas, someday items, completed work
     *Review System* (‘S’, ‘M’)
          Sub-menus for stuck and missed items
     *Archive* (‘A’)
          Archive completed items

     Try it: ‘M-x org-gtd-command-center’

If you are a Doom Emacs user, then your configuration may look something
like this:

     (use-package! org-gtd
       :after org
       :init
       ;; Set GTD directory before package loads
       (setq org-gtd-directory "~/gtd/")
       :custom
       (org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))
       (org-gtd-keyword-mapping '((todo . "TODO")
                                  (next . "NEXT")
                                  (wait . "WAIT")
                                  (done . "DONE")
                                  (canceled . "CNCL")))
       :config
       (org-edna-mode)
       ;; Add org-gtd files to your agenda (in :config so org-gtd-directory is defined)
       (setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))
       (map! :leader
             (:prefix ("d" . "org-gtd")

4.1 Quick Start Reference
=========================

If you haven't done the 5-minute Quick Start in the README yet, do that
first.  It walks you through:
  1. Capturing a single action
  2. Processing your inbox
  3. Organizing the item
  4. Seeing it in your engage view

   That Quick Start proves the basic cycle works.  Now let's see what
makes org-gtd special: automatic project management and custom views.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Tutorial Your First Project,  Next: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View,  Prev: Quick Start Reference,  Up: Getting Started with Org GTD

4.2 Tutorial: Your First Project
================================

You've captured and organized a single action.  That's great for simple
tasks, but GTD's real power is managing multi-step projects.  Let's
create one and watch org-gtd handle the complexity automatically.

4.2.1 What You'll Learn
-----------------------

   • How to capture and structure a project
   • How org-gtd automatically manages task dependencies
   • How tasks advance from TODO → NEXT when dependencies are satisfied
   • How the engage view shows you what's immediately actionable


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: The Project,  Next: Step 1 Capture the Project,  Prev: What You'll Learn,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.2 The Project
-----------------

We'll plan a small house renovation with three sequential steps:
  1. Review blueprints
  2. Order windows
  3. Schedule carpenter

   This demonstrates sequential project execution - the default behavior
where each task must complete before the next begins.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Step 1 Capture the Project,  Next: Step 2 Process the Inbox,  Prev: The Project,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.3 Step 1: Capture the Project
---------------------------------

Press ‘C-c d c’ (or ‘M-x org-gtd-capture’).

   Type (or paste) this structure:

     * House Renovation
     ** Review blueprints
     ** Order windows of the right size
     ** Schedule carpenter

   *Important*: Projects in org-gtd have a specific structure:
   • Top-level heading (‘*’) is the project name
   • Second-level headings (‘**’) are the tasks

   Press ‘C-c C-c’ to save.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Step 2 Process the Inbox,  Next: Step 3 Organize as a Project,  Prev: Step 1 Capture the Project,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.4 Step 2: Process the Inbox
-------------------------------

Press ‘C-c d p’ (or ‘M-x org-gtd-process-inbox’).

   You'll see your project in a clarify buffer.  This is your chance to
refine it:
   • Add details to tasks (we already added "of the right size" to
     clarify what we need)
   • Fix typos
   • Make everything crystal clear

   When you're satisfied, press ‘C-c c’ to organize.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Step 3 Organize as a Project,  Next: Step 4 View in Engage,  Prev: Step 2 Process the Inbox,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.5 Step 3: Organize as a Project
-----------------------------------

The transient menu appears with organization options.  Press *[p]* for
"Project".

   Watch what org-gtd does automatically:
  1. Marks the first task ("Review blueprints") as *NEXT*
  2. Marks other tasks as *TODO*
  3. Sets up dependency relationships (task 1 blocks task 2, task 2
     blocks task 3)
  4. Refiles the entire project to your projects file

   You'll see a prompt for tags (optional).  Press ‘RET’ to skip or add
tags if you want.

   The project is now in your GTD system!


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Step 4 View in Engage,  Next: Step 5 Complete the First Task,  Prev: Step 3 Organize as a Project,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.6 Step 4: View in Engage
----------------------------

Press ‘C-c d e’ (or ‘M-x org-gtd-engage’).

   You'll see an agenda view showing:
   • *NEXT: Review blueprints* - This is immediately actionable
   • The project "House Renovation" appears in the list
   • Other tasks ("Order windows", "Schedule carpenter") don't show as
     NEXT - they're waiting for the first task

   This is your daily engagement view - it shows *only* what you can act
on right now, not everything in your system.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Step 5 Complete the First Task,  Next: Step 6 Refresh and See the Change,  Prev: Step 4 View in Engage,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.7 Step 5: Complete the First Task
-------------------------------------

In the agenda view, move your cursor to "Review blueprints".

   Press *t* to cycle the TODO state.

   Select *DONE*.

   *Magic happens*: Watch "Order windows of the right size"
automatically become NEXT!

   This is org-edna in action - the automatic dependency system org-gtd
uses.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Step 6 Refresh and See the Change,  Next: What Just Happened?,  Prev: Step 5 Complete the First Task,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.8 Step 6: Refresh and See the Change
----------------------------------------

Press *g* to refresh the agenda view.

   You'll now see:
   • ✓ "Review blueprints" is DONE (depending on your agenda settings,
     it may be hidden)
   • *NEXT: Order windows of the right size* - Now actionable!
   • "Schedule carpenter" is still TODO - waiting for "Order windows" to
     complete


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: What Just Happened?,  Next: Continue the Project,  Prev: Step 6 Refresh and See the Change,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.9 What Just Happened?
-------------------------

Let's understand the automatic workflow:

  1. *When you organized as a project*, org-gtd:
        • Created a dependency chain: Task 1 → Task 2 → Task 3
        • Set properties (‘ORG_GTD_BLOCKS’, ‘ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON’) to
          track relationships
        • Marked only the first task as NEXT

  2. *When you marked "Review blueprints" DONE*, org-gtd:
        • Checked which tasks were blocked by this one
        • Found "Order windows" had no remaining blockers
        • Automatically changed it from TODO to NEXT

  3. *"Schedule carpenter" stays TODO* because:
        • It depends on "Order windows" completing
        • org-gtd won't mark it NEXT until its dependencies are
          satisfied

   You didn't manually manage any of this.  You just *did the work* and
marked tasks complete.  org-gtd handled the workflow automatically.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Continue the Project,  Next: Key Takeaways,  Prev: What Just Happened?,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.10 Continue the Project
---------------------------

Complete "Order windows" the same way:
  1. Go to the engage view (‘C-c d e’)
  2. Find "Order windows of the right size"
  3. When done, press *t* and select *DONE*
  4. Watch "Schedule carpenter" automatically become NEXT

   When all tasks are done, the project is complete.  You can archive it
with ‘M-x org-gtd-archive-completed-items’ during your weekly review.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Key Takeaways,  Next: What's Next?,  Prev: Continue the Project,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.11 Key Takeaways
--------------------

   • *Projects are multi-step actions* with automatic dependency
     management
   • *Sequential execution is the default* - tasks progress one after
     another
   • *The engage view shows only actionable items* - not everything in
     your system
   • *You focus on doing work, not managing workflows* - org-gtd handles
     task progression
   • *Completing tasks automatically advances projects* - no manual
     state management needed


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: What's Next?,  Prev: Key Takeaways,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.12 What's Next?
-------------------

This was a sequential project (A → B → C). Later, you'll learn how to:
   • Create *parallel tasks* (A and B can both be NEXT simultaneously)
   • Set *custom dependencies* (A blocks C, B blocks C, but A and B are
     parallel)
   • Manage *complex project structures* with the dependency graph

   For now, practice with a few simple sequential projects.  The pattern
is always:
  1. *Capture* with project structure
  2. *Clarify* to make it clear
  3. *Organize* as a project
  4. *Engage* to see what's actionable
  5. *Complete* tasks and watch progression happen automatically

4.3 Tutorial: Creating Your First Custom View
=============================================

The built-in ‘org-gtd-engage’ view is powerful, but you'll want custom
views for different contexts.  org-gtd 4.0 has a declarative View DSL
that makes this easy.  Let's create a view that shows all your active
projects.

   • How the View DSL works (declarative syntax)
   • How to create a simple custom view
   • How to call your view and see results
   • How to modify views for different needs


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Why This View?,  Next: Understanding the View DSL,  Prev: What You'll Learn (1),  Up: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View

4.3.2 Why This View?
--------------------

The engage view shows *today's actionable items* - what you should work
on right now.

   But sometimes you want the *big picture*:
   • What projects am I working on?
   • Which ones have active tasks?
   • What's the status of each project?

   This view answers those questions by showing all active projects at a
glance.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Understanding the View DSL,  Next: Creating the View Function,  Prev: Why This View?,  Up: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View

4.3.3 Understanding the View DSL
--------------------------------

Views in org-gtd are *declarative* - you describe *what* you want to
see, not *how* to find it.

   Here's the view we'll create:

     '((name . "My Active Projects")
       (type . active-project))

   Let's break this down:

‘name’
     What displays in the view header
‘type . active-project’
     Show projects with at least one active task

   That's it!  The View DSL translates this into an org-agenda view and
shows results.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Creating the View Function,  Next: Using Your View,  Prev: Understanding the View DSL,  Up: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View

4.3.4 Creating the View Function
--------------------------------

Add this to your init file (after your org-gtd configuration):

     (with-eval-after-load 'org-gtd
       (defun my-org-gtd-active-projects ()
         "Show all active projects."
         (interactive)
         (org-gtd-view-show
          '((name . "My Active Projects")
            (type . active-project)))))

   Save your init file and reload it (‘M-x eval-buffer’ or restart
Emacs).


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Using Your View,  Next: Binding to a Key,  Prev: Creating the View Function,  Up: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View

4.3.5 Using Your View
---------------------

Now you can call it:

     M-x my-org-gtd-active-projects

   You'll see a list of all your active projects!


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Binding to a Key,  Next: What You'll See,  Prev: Using Your View,  Up: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View

4.3.6 Binding to a Key
----------------------

For quick access, bind it to a key.  Add this to your configuration:

     ;; If using vanilla Emacs
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d P") 'my-org-gtd-active-projects)

     ;; If using Doom Emacs, add to your org-gtd config:
     (map! :leader
           (:prefix "d"
            :desc "Active projects" "P" #'my-org-gtd-active-projects))

     ;; If using Spacemacs, add to your config:
     (spacemacs/set-leader-keys "od P" 'my-org-gtd-active-projects)

   Now press ‘C-c d P’ (or your binding) to see active projects
instantly!


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: What You'll See,  Next: Experiment Modify the View,  Prev: Binding to a Key,  Up: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View

4.3.7 What You'll See
---------------------

The view shows:
   • All projects that have at least one active task
   • Each project's current state (what tasks are NEXT, TODO, etc.)
   • Project names and context

   Projects that are:
   • Completely DONE - Won't appear (no active tasks)
   • Canceled - Won't appear (no active tasks)
   • Have only TODO/NEXT/WAIT tasks - Will appear

4.3.8 Experiment: Modify the View
---------------------------------

Try these variations to see how the View DSL works:

   *Show ALL projects (including completed):*

     (defun my-org-gtd-all-projects ()
       "Show all projects, including completed ones."
       (interactive)
       (org-gtd-view-show
        '((name . "All Projects")
          (type . project))))

   *Show stuck projects:*

     (defun my-org-gtd-stuck-projects ()
       "Show projects that have work but no NEXT actions."
       (interactive)
       (org-gtd-view-show
        '((name . "Stuck Projects")
          (type . stuck-project))))

   *Show projects in a specific area of focus* (if you use areas):

     (defun my-org-gtd-work-projects ()
       "Show only work projects."
       (interactive)
       (org-gtd-view-show
        '((name . "Work Projects")
          (type . active-project)
          (area-of-focus . "Work"))))


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Available Filters,  Next: Key Takeaways (1),  Prev: Experiment Modify the View,  Up: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View

4.3.9 Available Filters
-----------------------

For the complete View DSL reference, see *note View DSL Filter
Reference::.

   Here are common filters you can use in your views:

   *GTD Types:*
‘(type . next-action)’
     Single actions ready to do
‘(type . delegated)’
     Items delegated to others
‘(type . calendar)’

4.3.10 Key Takeaways
--------------------

   • *Views are declarative* - you describe what you want, not how to
     get it
   • *The View DSL is readable* - it's data, not complex code
   • *Views are easy to create and modify* - just change the filter list
   • *You can create unlimited views* - for different contexts and needs
   • *Native org-agenda* - efficient skip functions without external
     dependencies


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: What's Next? (1),  Prev: Key Takeaways (1),  Up: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View

4.3.11 What's Next?
-------------------

Now that you understand views, you can create:
   • *Review views* - For your weekly/monthly reviews
   • *Context views* - Show work items, home items, errands, etc.
   • *Time-based views* - Overdue items, upcoming deadlines, this week's
     schedule
   • *Focus views* - Deep work items (‘priority’, ‘clocked’), quick wins
     (‘effort’)

   Now that you can create views, let's build some that match real
workflows.

4.4 Tutorial: Quick Wins and Focus Work Views
=============================================

You've learned to create views.  Now let's create views that match *how
you actually work*--views that answer: "What can I knock out in 10
minutes?"  and "What deserves my deep focus?"

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Why This Matters,  Next: Your First Quick Wins View (30 seconds),  Up: Tutorial Quick Wins and Focus Work Views

4.4.1 Why This Matters
----------------------

Think about your typical day:

   • *10 minutes before a meeting* → You want quick tasks you can
     complete
   • *2-hour focus block* → You want substantial work, not busywork
   • *Weekly review* → You want to find tasks missing estimates

   These three scenarios need different views.  The engage view shows
*everything actionable*.  These views show *what matches your available
time and energy*.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Your First Quick Wins View (30 seconds),  Next: The Effort Filter Explained,  Prev: Why This Matters,  Up: Tutorial Quick Wins and Focus Work Views

4.4.2 Your First Quick Wins View (30 seconds)
---------------------------------------------

Let's start with the most immediately useful view: tasks under 15
minutes.

   Try this right now in your ‘*scratch*’ buffer:

     (org-gtd-view-show
      '((name . "Quick Wins")
        (type . next-action)
        (effort . (< "15min"))))

   Place your cursor at the end and press ‘C-x C-e’.

   *What you'll see:* Only NEXT actions that have an effort estimate
under 15 minutes.  Perfect for those short gaps in your day.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: The Effort Filter Explained,  Next: Building a Focus Work View,  Prev: Your First Quick Wins View (30 seconds),  Up: Tutorial Quick Wins and Focus Work Views

4.4.3 The Effort Filter Explained
---------------------------------

The ‘effort’ filter works with your items' Effort property--the same one
org-mode uses for time estimates.

   The pattern is simple:

     (effort . (< "TIME"))    ;; less than TIME
     (effort . (> "TIME"))    ;; more than TIME
     (effort . (between "MIN" "MAX"))  ;; within range

   Time formats work how you'd expect:
   • ‘"15min"’ or ‘"0:15"’ → 15 minutes
   • ‘"1:30"’ or ‘"1h30min"’ → 1 hour 30 minutes
   • ‘"2:00"’ or ‘"2h"’ → 2 hours

   *The mental model:* Think of effort as "how big is this bite?"  Quick
wins are small bites.  Deep work is a full meal.

4.4.4 Building a Focus Work View
--------------------------------

Now let's create a view for when you have real time to focus.  You want
tasks that:
   • Are important (priority A or B)
   • Are substantial (over 30 minutes)

     (org-gtd-view-show
      '((name . "Focus Work")
        (type . next-action)
        (priority . (>= B))
        (effort . (> "30min"))))

   *What this shows:* NEXT actions that are priority B or higher AND
estimated over 30 minutes.  These are tasks worth blocking time for.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: The Priority Filter Explained,  Next: Finding Tasks to Triage,  Prev: Building a Focus Work View,  Up: Tutorial Quick Wins and Focus Work Views

4.4.5 The Priority Filter Explained
-----------------------------------

Priority in org-mode goes A (highest) → B → C (lowest).  The ‘priority’
filter matches this:

     (priority . A)           ;; exactly priority A
     (priority . (A B))       ;; priority A or B
     (priority . (>= B))      ;; B or higher (A and B)
     (priority . nil)         ;; no priority set

   *Important:* A is *highest* priority.  So ‘(>= B)’ means "B or
better"--which is A and B.

   *The mental model:* Priority answers "how important is this?"  Effort
answers "how long will it take?"  Together they help you match tasks to

4.4.6 Finding Tasks to Triage
-----------------------------

One more powerful pattern: finding items missing metadata.  During your
weekly review, you want to catch tasks that need estimates.

     (org-gtd-view-show
      '((name . "Needs Effort Estimate")
        (type . next-action)
        (effort . nil)))

   ‘(effort . nil)’ matches items with NO effort property set.  Same
works for priority:

     (org-gtd-view-show
      '((name . "Needs Priority")
        (type . next-action)
        (priority . nil)))

   These triage views help maintain your system.

4.4.7 Bonus: The Clocked Filter
-------------------------------

There's one more filter: ‘clocked’.  It matches by how much time you've
*already invested* in a task.

     ;; Tasks I've started but not finished (some time clocked)
     (org-gtd-view-show
      '((name . "In Progress")
        (type . next-action)
        (clocked . (> "0:00"))))

     ;; Tasks I haven't touched yet
     (org-gtd-view-show
      '((name . "Not Started")
        (type . next-action)
        (clocked . nil)))

   *Why this is useful:* Sometimes you want to continue work you've
already invested in.  Sometimes you want fresh tasks.  The clocked
filter gives you both options.

4.4.8 Putting It All Together
-----------------------------

Here's a complete setup with three views for different contexts:

     (with-eval-after-load 'org-gtd
       (defun my-quick-wins ()
         "Tasks under 15 minutes - perfect for short gaps."
         (interactive)
         (org-gtd-view-show
          '((name . "Quick Wins (< 15min)")
            (type . next-action)
            (effort . (< "15min")))))

       (defun my-focus-work ()
         "Important substantial tasks - for deep work blocks."
         (interactive)
         (org-gtd-view-show
          '((name . "Focus Work")
            (type . next-action)
            (priority . (>= B))
            (effort . (> "30min")))))

       (defun my-needs-estimates ()
         "Tasks missing effort or priority - for weekly review."
         (interactive)
         (org-gtd-view-show
          '(((name . "Needs Priority")
             (type . next-action)
             (priority . nil))
            ((name . "Needs Effort")
             (type . next-action)
             (effort . nil))))))

4.4.9 Key Takeaways
-------------------

   • ‘effort’ filter matches time estimates → "How big is this task?"
   • ‘priority’ filter matches A/B/C → "How important is this?"
   • ‘clocked’ filter matches time invested → "How much have I worked on
     this?"
   • Use ‘nil’ to find items missing metadata
   • Combine filters to match your available time and energy

4.4.10 Where to Go From Here
----------------------------

You've completed the tutorials.  You now know how to:
  1. Create and manage projects (Tutorial 1)
  2. Create custom views for any context (Tutorial 2)
  3. Build quick wins, focus work, and triage views (Tutorial 3)

   *This is enough to be productive with org-gtd!*

   Read those sections as you need them.  For now, *start using what
you've learned*:
   • Capture items as they come up
   • Process your inbox regularly (daily if possible)
   • Use the engage view to see what's actionable
   • Create a few simple projects
   • Experiment with custom views

   The best way to learn GTD is to practice the workflow.  org-gtd
handles the complexity--you just do the work.

5.1 Your Daily Workflow
=======================

The GTD workflow has six steps.  You'll do the first four frequently
(even daily), and the last two periodically:

  1. *Capture* - Get things out of your head into your inbox
     (‘org-gtd-capture’)
  2. *Process* - Look at each inbox item one at a time
     (‘org-gtd-process-inbox’)
  3. *Clarify* - Edit the item to make it clear and actionable
  4. *Organize* - Categorize the item (‘org-gtd-organize’)
  5. *Engage* - Look at what you can do right now (‘org-gtd-engage’)
  6. *Review* - Periodically review your system for health

   You already practiced this in the *note Getting Started tutorials:
Getting Started with Org GTD. The sections below go deeper into each
part.

5.2 The GTD Flow in Depth
=========================

Here are the domain elements of GTD that we handle:

* Menu:

* Adding things to the inbox::
* Processing the inbox::
* Clarifying each item::
* Organizing an item into the system::
* Engaging with your GTD items::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Adding things to the inbox,  Next: Processing the inbox,  Up: The GTD Flow in Depth

5.2.1 Adding things to the inbox
--------------------------------

The trip through GTD arguably begins by adding things to the inbox.  The
inbox is a file called ‘inbox.org’ in the directory stored in the
variable ‘org-gtd-directory’.  By default this means the file will be
‘~/gtd/inbox.org’.

   Org GTD provides one function to capture items: ‘M-x
org-gtd-capture’.  In my setup I have this bound globally as such:

     (global-set-key "C-c d c" #'org-gtd-capture)

   This function uses the variable ‘org-gtd-capture-templates’ to define
org-gtd-specific capture templates.  By default it comes with two
templates, one to just capture a new item, and one to capture an item
with a link to the file where you were when you started the capture.

   You can customize these templates as you see fit.  In order to
maintain proper functioning of org-gtd, however, there are two
constraints:

  1. the first two characters of the template string must be a single
     asterisk followed by a space: ‘"* "’
  2. the entry type must be like this: ‘entry (file
     ,#'org-gtd-inbox-path)’

   *See also*: *note Configuration Variables Reference:: for complete
documentation of ‘org-gtd-capture-templates’ and ‘org-gtd-directory’.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Processing the inbox,  Next: Clarifying each item,  Prev: Adding things to the inbox,  Up: The GTD Flow in Depth

5.2.2 Processing the inbox
--------------------------

Processing the inbox means taking everything in the inbox, one at a
time, and refining/categorizing them so they are instantly useful when
you are looking at available next / scheduled actions.

   You can start processing the inbox with ‘org-gtd-process-inbox’.
This starts a looping behavior of clarifying each item in the inbox.

   If you capture items from multiple sources (mobile app, email,
different contexts), you can configure additional inbox files.  After
the main inbox is empty, processing continues through each additional
file in order.  See ‘org-gtd-additional-inbox-files’ in *note
Configuration Variables Reference::.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Clarifying each item,  Next: Organizing an item into the system,  Prev: Processing the inbox,  Up: The GTD Flow in Depth

5.2.3 Clarifying each item
--------------------------

Clarifying an item means editing and adding the information that will be
most valuable to you to the item.  Note that task-specific information,
such as appointment date, or name of person to whom it is delegated, or
even area of focus, will be added during the Organize step, so don't
worry about these yet.

   • How to start clarifying

     Besides ending up in here automatically while processing the inbox,
     there's two more ways to enter the clarifying flow:

     ‘org-gtd-clarify-item’
          call this from any org-mode heading to do a one-off
          clarification.
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-agenda-item’
          call this from the agenda view, if you have anything you want
          to re-clarify, or possibly clarify for the first time, from
          somewhere outside the inbox.

   • data shape requirements

     There's two general shapes you'll be looking for.  Almost
     everything will look like a simple org-mode heading.  For instance,
     ‘* Task desc’.

     The only exception will be a project, that will look like a
     top-level heading for the project description with, underneath, a
     series of second-level headings representing each task to be
     executed sequentially before the project is complete.

          * Project heading
          ** First task
          ** Second task
          ** Third task

   • Options and commands related to clarification

     The clarify buffers use the major mode ‘org-gtd-clarify-mode’,
     which is derived from ‘org-mode’.  There is a keymap,
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-mode-map’, that you can use to bind useful
     keybindings.

     org-gtd provides three optional helper windows during
     clarification, each controlled by a variable:

     **Horizons window** — shows your GTD horizons file for context:
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-show-horizons’
          set to ‘'right’, ‘'left’, ‘'top’, or ‘'bottom’ to show by
          default; ‘nil’ to hide
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-toggle-horizons-window’
          command to toggle visibility

     See *note Working with the GTD Horizons:: for more details.

     **Organize help window** — shows all GTD item types with keyboard
     shortcuts:
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-show-organize-help’
          set to ‘'right’, ‘'left’, ‘'top’, or ‘'bottom’ to show by
          default; ‘nil’ to hide
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-toggle-organize-help’
          command to toggle visibility

     **Dependencies helper window** — shows task relationships when
     clarifying projects:
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-display-helper-buffer’
          set to ‘t’ to show when clarifying projects with multiple
          tasks; ‘nil’ to hide

     Try it now: while clarifying an item, run ‘M-x
     org-gtd-clarify-toggle-organize-help’.  You'll see each type's
     purpose and what happens when you choose it.

     If you are clarifying a project, you may be interested in project
     templates:
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-project-insert-template’
          a function that will ask you to choose a template to insert.
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-project-templates’
          an alist of the form ‘(name . template)’ where both name and
          template are strings.  ‘name’ will be used in the interactive
          menu, and ‘template’ will be inserted in the buffer.

     *See also*: *note Configuration Variables Reference:: for complete
     documentation of clarification options, and *note Commands
     Reference:: for all clarification commands.

   • Duplicating items during clarification

     Sometimes one inbox item represents multiple outcomes.  "Prepare
     for Monday meeting" might actually be three things: book the room,
     prepare the slides, and email the agenda.  The duplicate feature
     lets you split these apart during clarification.

     **Who needs this:** Anyone who captures quick notes that later turn
     out to be multiple separate actions or projects.

        • Your first duplicate in 30 seconds

            1. While clarifying any item, press ‘C-c d’
            2. Edit the title in the minibuffer (or keep it the same)
            3. Press ‘RET’

          That's it.  A queue window appears showing your duplicate.
          Continue clarifying and organizing the original item—the
          duplicate waits its turn.

        • Understanding the workflow

          Think of duplicates as a "spawn" operation.  You're clarifying
          item A, and you realize it's actually A, B, and C.  You spawn
          B and C as duplicates, then:

            1. Organize A (the original)
            2. Automatically, B opens for clarification
            3. Organize B
            4. Automatically, C opens for clarification
            5. Organize C
            6. Done—back to where you started

          The key insight: *duplicates form a mini-session*.  You must
          process all of them before returning to your previous context.
          This matches the GTD principle of fully processing what's in
          front of you before moving on.

        • The queue window

          When you create your first duplicate, a side window appears:

               Pending (2):
                 1. Book the room
                 2. Email the agenda

          This window:
             • Shows all queued duplicates by title
             • Updates as you add more or process them
             • Closes automatically when the last duplicate is organized
             • Position is configurable (default: bottom)

        • Two ways to duplicate

          Key       Command                             Behavior
          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
          ‘C-c d’   ‘org-gtd-clarify-duplicate’         Prompts for new title (current title as default)
          ‘C-c D’   ‘org-gtd-clarify-duplicate-exact’   Copies exactly, no prompt

          Use ‘C-c d’ when the duplicates have different titles (most
          common).  Use ‘C-c D’ when you want identical copies to
          organize differently (e.g., same task delegated to multiple
          people).

        • What happens if you cancel?

          If you press ‘C-c C-k’ to stop clarifying while duplicates are
          queued, you'll see:

               2 pending duplicates:
                 - Book the room
                 - Email the agenda
               [d]iscard all  [s]ave to inbox  [c]ancel:

             • *Discard*: Duplicates are lost (you decided you don't
               need them)
             • *Save to inbox*: Duplicates are appended to your inbox
               for later processing
             • *Cancel*: Return to the clarify buffer (abort the abort)

        • Nested duplicates

          While clarifying a duplicate, you can create more duplicates.
          They append to the queue.  All must be processed before
          returning to your original context.

        • Data safety

          Duplicates exist only in memory until organized.  If Emacs
          crashes, they're lost.  However:

             • Before exiting Emacs normally, you'll be prompted if any
               clarify buffers have pending duplicates
             • You can save them to inbox or discard them
             • The WIP buffer itself has auto-save enabled, so your
               clarification work is protected

        • Configuration

               ;; Change queue window position (default: 'bottom)
               ;; Options: 'top, 'right, 'left, 'bottom
               (setq org-gtd-clarify-duplicate-queue-position 'right)

          *See also*: *note Commands Reference:: for
          ‘org-gtd-clarify-duplicate’ and

5.2.4 Organizing an item into the system
----------------------------------------

When you are done clarifying, call ‘M-x org-gtd-organize’ (or hit your
keybinding for it, see *note Recommended key bindings::).  This will
open a transient menu to let you choose how Org GTD should categorize
this item.

   Organizing is broken up into three steps:
   • Choosing a task type (see *note Understanding GTD Item Types::)
   • Applying hooks to add additional relevant information (see *note
     Hooks Framework Reference::)
   • Refiling to the appropriate area (see *note Refiling: Refiling to
     the appropriate area. below)

   *See also*: *note Commands Reference:: for the ‘org-gtd-organize’
command and all organization-related commands.

   • Refiling to the appropriate area

        • Understanding Refiling in V4

          In org-gtd v4, refiling is *optional organizational
          preference*, not a structural requirement.  Items can exist
          anywhere in your ‘org-agenda-files’.

          By default, org-gtd uses ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE’ properties to mark
          refile target headings.  These can be at *any level* in *any
          file* in ‘org-agenda-files’.

        • Refile Target System

          Org-gtd *merges* your ‘org-refile-targets’ configuration with
          its own ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE’ property-based targets:

            1. Your configured ‘org-refile-targets’ appear first
            2. Org-gtd's ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE’ targets appear after

          This means you can use both org-mode's standard refile
          configuration AND org-gtd's property-based system together.

          Org-gtd finds refile targets by searching for ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE’
          property:

               * Projects         <-- Can be anywhere, any level
               :PROPERTIES:
               :ORG_GTD_REFILE: Projects
               :END:

               ** Work/
               *** Development Projects   <-- Also a valid refile target!
               :PROPERTIES:
               :ORG_GTD_REFILE: Projects
               :END:

          When you organize an item as a Project, org-gtd finds *all*
          headings with ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE: Projects’ (plus any targets
          from your ‘org-refile-targets’).

             • Controlling Refile Prompts by Item Type

               When you have multiple refile targets, you might want
               org-gtd to prompt for some item types but auto-refile
               others.  For example: always prompt when organizing
               projects (you care where they go), but auto-refile quick
               actions (just get them out of the inbox).

               *Important:* First, you must opt into per-type control by
               setting:

                    (setq org-gtd-refile-to-any-target nil)

               By default ‘org-gtd-refile-to-any-target’ is ‘t’, which
               makes org-gtd auto-refile everything without prompting.

               Once you've opted in, the
               ‘org-gtd-refile-prompt-for-types’ variable controls which
               types prompt.  It's a list of GTD item types that should
               prompt for target selection:

                    ;; Default value - these types prompt for refile target:
                    (setq org-gtd-refile-prompt-for-types
                          '(single-action project-heading project-task calendar
                            someday delegated tickler habit))

               Item types *not* in the list auto-refile to the first
               available target.  By default, ‘quick-action’,
               ‘knowledge’, and ‘trash’ auto-refile.

               *Example: Auto-refile everything except projects*

               If you want maximum speed and only care about choosing
               project locations:

                    (setq org-gtd-refile-prompt-for-types '(project-heading project-task))

               *Example: Always prompt for everything*

               If you always want to choose where items go:

                    (setq org-gtd-refile-prompt-for-types
                          '(single-action project-heading project-task calendar
                            someday delegated tickler habit knowledge quick-action trash))

               *Valid type symbols:* ‘single-action’, ‘project-heading’,
               ‘project-task’, ‘calendar’, ‘someday’, ‘delegated’,
               ‘tickler’, ‘habit’, ‘knowledge’, ‘quick-action’, ‘trash’

        • Creating New Refile Targets

          To create a new refile target, add ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE’ property
          to any heading:

          For Projects:
               * My Projects
               :PROPERTIES:
               :ORG_GTD_REFILE: Projects
               :END:

          For other types, use the appropriate template constant value:
             • Projects: ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE: Projects’
             • Actions: ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE: Actions’
             • Calendar: ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE: Calendar’
             • Tickler: ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE: Tickler’
             • Someday: ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE: Someday’
             • Habits: ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE: Habits’

             • Multiple Types Per Heading

               A single heading can accept multiple GTD types by listing
               them space-separated:

                    * Work Tasks
                    :PROPERTIES:
                    :ORG_GTD_REFILE: Actions Projects
                    :END:

               This heading will appear as a valid target when
               organizing both single actions AND projects.  Useful when
               you want to organize related items under a common parent.

               If no refile target exists when organizing, org-gtd
               automatically creates one in your default GTD file.

        • Using Your Own Refile Targets

          If you have existing ‘org-refile-targets’ configuration,
          org-gtd automatically merges your targets with its own:

               ;; Your refile configuration is respected and merged
               (setq org-refile-targets '(("~/org/notes.org" :maxlevel . 2)
                                          ("~/org/work.org" :maxlevel . 3)))

          Your targets appear *first* in the refile completion list,
          followed by org-gtd's ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE’ targets.  Files inside
          ‘org-gtd-directory’ are filtered by the ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE’
          property; files outside are available as-is.

        • Migration from V3

          V3 required this structure:
               * Projects      <-- MUST be level 1
               :PROPERTIES:
               :ORG_GTD: Projects    <-- Dual-purpose property
               :END:

          V4 is flexible:
               * Projects      <-- Can be anywhere, any level
               :PROPERTIES:
               :ORG_GTD_REFILE: Projects    <-- Marks refile target
               :END:

          The upgrade script (‘org-gtd-upgrade-v3-to-v4’) automatically
          renames ‘ORG_GTD’ → ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE’ on your old category
          headings.

5.2.5 Engaging with your GTD items
----------------------------------

You can see a list of all NEXT actions, and scheduled actions, with ‘M-x
org-gtd-engage’ .

   You can call ‘org-gtd-show-all-next’ to only see NEXT actions,
nothing scheduled.

   You can use ‘M-x org-gtd-reflect-missed-engagements’ to find
appointments you missed, delegated items needing check-ins, and late
projects.  This is your safety net for catching things that slipped
through the cracks.

   The weekly review is not yet implemented.

   • Quick Task Actions from the Agenda

        • First Contact: Why This Feature?

          When you're working from ‘org-gtd-engage’, you see your NEXT
          actions and scheduled items.  You want to mark things done,
          defer something to tomorrow, or clock in on a task - but you
          don't want to navigate away from your list.

          ‘org-gtd-agenda-transient’ gives you quick access to common
          task operations right from the agenda view.  One keypress,
          pick an action, and you're back to your list.

          *For GTD users* who spend time in their daily agenda and want
          to execute tasks efficiently without context-switching.

        • Black Triangle: Your First Quick Action

            1. Open your engage view: ‘C-c d e’ (or ‘M-x
               org-gtd-engage’)
            2. Move point to any task
            3. Press ‘C-c .’ (you'll need to set up the keybinding first
               - see below)
            4. Press ‘d’ to mark the task DONE

          That's it.  The task is done, and you're still in your agenda.

          *Setup:* Add this keybinding to your config:

               (define-key org-agenda-mode-map (kbd "C-c .") #'org-gtd-agenda-transient)

          For ‘use-package’, add this to your ‘:bind’ section:

               :bind
               (:map org-agenda-mode-map
                ("C-c ." . org-gtd-agenda-transient))

        • Understanding the Actions

          The transient menu is organized into groups based on what
          you're trying to do:

             • State Changes

               Change the TODO state of a task.  These are the most
               common actions:

                  • *Mark DONE* (‘d’) - You finished it
                  • *Set WAITING* (‘w’) - You're blocked on
                    something/someone
                  • *Set NEXT* (‘n’) - It's ready to work on
                  • *Cancel* (‘x’) - It's no longer relevant
                  • *Cycle TODO* (‘t’) - Cycle through all states

             • Time Adjustments (Conditional)

               For Calendar, Delegated, and Tickler items only - these
               have GTD timestamps that determine when they appear.

                  • *Defer 1 day* (‘+’) - Push it to tomorrow (quick
                    snooze)
                  • *Set date* (‘s’) - Pick a new date (calls
                    ‘org-gtd-set-timestamp’)

               Why only these types?  Calendar items have appointment
               dates.  Delegated items have follow-up dates.  Tickler
               items have "remind me on" dates.  Habits are excluded
               because deferring a habit has different semantics (you'd
               break the streak).

               *Note*: You can also call ‘org-gtd-set-timestamp’
               directly from an org-mode heading (not just from the
               agenda).  This is useful when editing a Calendar,
               Delegated, or Tickler item in its source file.

             • Clocking

               Track time spent on tasks:

                  • *Clock in* (‘I’) - Start the clock
                  • *Clock out* (‘O’) - Stop the clock

             • Metadata

               Add context to tasks:

                  • *Set effort* (‘e’) - Estimate how long it'll take
                  • *Set priority* (‘,’) - A/B/C priority
                  • *Set tags* (‘:’) - Add tags for filtering
                  • *Add note* (‘z’) - Append a note (logged with
                    timestamp)
                  • *Area of focus* (‘a’) - Set which life area this
                    belongs to

             • Clarify

               Sometimes you need to rethink a task:

                  • *Clarify (refile)* (‘c’) - Open the clarify
                    workflow, refile when done
                  • *Clarify (in place)* (‘C’) - Open the clarify
                    workflow, keep in same GTD location

        • Command Reference

          Key   Action               Description
          ----------------------------------------------------------------------
          ‘d’   Mark DONE            Complete the task
          ‘w’   Set WAITING          Mark as blocked/waiting
          ‘n’   Set NEXT             Mark as ready to work on
          ‘x’   Cancel               Cancel the task
          ‘t’   Cycle TODO           Cycle through TODO states
          ‘+’   Defer 1 day          Push to tomorrow (time-based items only)
          ‘s’   Set date             Pick new date (time-based items only)
          ‘I’   Clock in             Start time tracking
          ‘O’   Clock out            Stop time tracking
          ‘e’   Set effort           Estimate duration
          ‘,’   Set priority         Set A/B/C priority
          ‘:’   Set tags             Add/modify tags
          ‘z’   Add note             Append timestamped note
          ‘a’   Area of focus        Set life area
          ‘c’   Clarify (refile)     Re-clarify and refile
          ‘C’   Clarify (in place)   Re-clarify, keep location
          ‘q’   Quit                 Close the menu

        • Suggested Keybinding

          The command isn't bound by default because org-agenda-mode
          already has many keybindings.  The suggested binding is ‘C-c
          .’ which follows the ‘C-c’ prefix convention for user
          bindings:

               (define-key org-agenda-mode-map (kbd "C-c .") #'org-gtd-agenda-transient)

5.3 Understanding GTD Item Types
================================

When you organize an item (‘org-gtd-organize’), a transient menu appears
with different item types.  This section explains what each type means
and when to use it.

   You already saw *Projects* and *Single actions* in the tutorials.
Here's the complete reference for all item types:

* Menu:

* Single Action [S]::
* Project [P]::
* Add to existing project [A]::
* Calendar [C]::
* Delegate [D]::
* Quick Action [Q]::
* Tickler [I]::
* Someday/Maybe [y]::
* Habit [H]::
* Knowledge [K]::
* Trash [T]::
* Working with the GTD Horizons::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Single Action [S],  Next: Project [P],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.1 Single Action [S]
-----------------------

*What it is*: A one-off task to do when you have time and energy.

   *When to use it*: For standalone tasks that aren't time-sensitive,
don't depend on anyone else, and can be done whenever you're ready.

   *Examples*:
   • Buy birthday gift for Alex
   • Read article about GTD methodology
   • Update profile photo
   • Clean garage

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Marks it as NEXT (immediately actionable)
   • Refiles to your actions file
   • Shows in ‘org-gtd-engage’ view


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Project [P],  Next: Add to existing project [A],  Prev: Single Action [S],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.2 Project [P]
-----------------

*What it is*: A multi-step action requiring more than one task to
complete.

   *When to use it*: When accomplishing your goal requires multiple
sequential (or parallel) steps.

   *Examples*:
   • House renovation (review blueprints → order materials → schedule
     work)
   • Launch product (design → build → test → deploy → announce)
   • Plan vacation (research destinations → book flights → arrange
     accommodation)

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Creates dependency relationships between tasks
   • Marks first task(s) as NEXT, others as TODO
   • Automatically advances tasks as you complete them
   • Refiles entire project to your projects file

   See *note Working with Projects: Working with Projects (Advanced).
for advanced features (parallel tasks, custom dependencies).


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Add to existing project [A],  Next: Calendar [C],  Prev: Project [P],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.3 Add to existing project [A]
---------------------------------

*What it is*: Add the current task to a project that already exists.

   *When to use it*: When you realize a project needs an additional
task, or you're breaking down a project task into sub-tasks.

   *Examples*:
   • Adding "Get permits" to your house renovation project
   • Adding "Write announcement email" to your product launch project

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Prompts you to choose which project
   • Inserts task into project (position depends on
     ‘org-reverse-note-order’)
   • Task keywords may need adjustment - use
     ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords-for-project-at-point’ on the
     project heading if needed


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Calendar [C],  Next: Delegate [D],  Prev: Add to existing project [A],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.4 Calendar [C]
------------------

*What it is*: An action that must be done at a specific date or time.

   *When to use it*: For appointments, events, or time-sensitive tasks.

   *Examples*:
   • Doctor appointment on Tuesday at 2pm
   • Team meeting every Monday at 9am
   • Submit report by Friday 5pm (deadline)
   • Call contractor on Thursday

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Prompts for date/time
   • Adds timestamp to ‘ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP’ property
   • Marks as NEXT
   • Shows in agenda views at the appropriate time

   *Note*: This is for calendar items, not scheduled work blocks.  In
GTD, scheduling means "do this at this time," not "start working on this
someday."


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Delegate [D],  Next: Quick Action [Q],  Prev: Calendar [C],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.5 Delegate [D]
------------------

*What it is*: A task someone else will do, but you need to follow up on.

   *When to use it*: When you're waiting for someone else to complete
something and you need to check back.

   *Examples*:
   • Waiting for designer to finish mockups
   • Asked colleague to review document
   • IT to fix laptop issue
   • Contractor to provide estimate

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Prompts for: person name, follow-up date
   • Sets ‘DELEGATED_TO’ property
   • Marks as WAIT
   • Shows in waiting-for views
   • Appears in agenda on follow-up date

   *Customization*: Set ‘org-gtd-delegate-read-func’ to use completion
for names.

   *Converting actions to delegated*:

   Sometimes you start a task yourself, then realize you need to hand it
off.  If you change any action item to WAIT (using ‘org-todo’ or ‘C-c
C-t’), org-gtd prompts: "Convert to delegated item?"

   If you confirm, you provide who has it and when to follow up.  The
item becomes a proper delegated item with full tracking.

   This ensures your waiting-for list always has the context GTD
requires: who has it and when to check back.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Quick Action [Q],  Next: Tickler [I],  Prev: Delegate [D],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.6 Quick Action [Q]
----------------------

*What it is*: Tasks that take less than 2 minutes.

   *When to use it*: For trivial tasks you can do immediately.

   *Examples*:
   • Reply to quick email
   • File a document
   • Add item to shopping list
   • Send calendar invite

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Marks as DONE
   • Archives immediately
   • Assumes you just did it

   *GTD principle*: If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now.  Don't
organize it - just do it and mark it done.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Tickler [I],  Next: Someday/Maybe [y],  Prev: Quick Action [Q],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.7 Tickler [I]
-----------------

*What it is*: Items with a specific review date - things you want to be
reminded about at a future time.

   *When to use it*: For ideas, projects, or actions you're not ready
for NOW but want to reconsider on a specific date.

   *Examples*:
   • Project paused until Q2 starts (review on April 1st)
   • Check if new API is released (review monthly)
   • Consider kitchen remodel when bonus arrives (review in June)
   • Revisit proposal after team meeting (review next week)

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Prompts for review date
   • Sets ‘ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP’ property with the date
   • Refiles to tickler file
   • Will remind you in agenda on that date to reconsider

   *Use case - Paused projects*: You can tickler entire projects to
temporarily hide them from your active views while preserving all
structure and dependencies.  See *note Tickler Projects: Tickler
Projects Pausing Work You're Not Ready For. for details.

   *State Preservation*: Like someday items, tickler saves your item's
current state (‘ORG_GTD’, TODO keyword, and type-specific properties
like ‘DELEGATED_TO’).  When the review date arrives and you run ‘M-x
org-gtd-reactivate’, you'll be prompted to confirm or update each
property.

   *GTD principle*: The tickler file is a time-based reminder system.
Items appear when the date arrives, prompting you to decide if you're
ready to act.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Someday/Maybe [y],  Next: Habit [H],  Prev: Tickler [I],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.8 Someday/Maybe [y]
-----------------------

*What it is*: Ideas or possibilities with no specific timeframe - things
you might do eventually but have no commitment to.

   *When to use it*: For ideas you want to keep but aren't ready to
commit time or energy to, and don't need a specific review date.

   *Examples*:
   • Learn Spanish (someday)
   • Write a book (maybe)
   • Build a woodworking shop (no timeline)
   • Take photography class (when life permits)

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Sets ‘ORG_GTD: Someday’ property (no timestamp)
   • Refiles to a someday/maybe category
   • Stays out of active views until you explicitly review it

   *How to review*: Use ‘org-gtd-reflect-someday-review’ to walk through
your someday items one by one and decide whether to keep deferring or
reactivate them.  See *note Reviewing Someday/Maybe Items:: for details.

   *Key difference from Tickler*: Someday items have NO review date.
They don't appear in your agenda automatically.  You choose when to
review them (typically during weekly/monthly reviews).

   *GTD principle*: Someday/maybe items acknowledge possibilities
without cluttering your active system.  They're safe to ignore until
you're ready.

   *State Preservation*: When you move an item TO someday, org-gtd
automatically saves its current state:
   • ‘ORG_GTD’ value → saved to ‘PREVIOUS_ORG_GTD’
   • TODO keyword → saved to ‘PREVIOUS_TODO’
   • Type-specific properties (e.g., ‘DELEGATED_TO’, ‘SCHEDULED’) →
     saved to ‘PREVIOUS_*’ versions

   This means a delegated action moved to someday will remember who it
was delegated to, and a calendar item will remember its original date.

   *Reactivating Someday Items*: When you're ready to work on a someday
item again, use ‘M-x org-gtd-reactivate’.  For non-project items, you'll
be prompted to confirm or update each preserved property (e.g.,
"Delegated to [Jane Smith]: ").  This lets you adjust for the time that
has passed while keeping your original planning work.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Habit [H],  Next: Knowledge [K],  Prev: Someday/Maybe [y],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.9 Habit [H]
---------------

*What it is*: Recurring tasks you want to track consistently (org-mode
habits).

   *When to use it*: For building routines and tracking streaks.

   *Examples*:
   • Exercise daily
   • Write in journal
   • Review finances weekly
   • Call parents monthly

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Prompts for: repeat pattern (e.g., "daily", "+1w"), start date
   • Creates org-mode habit with consistency tracking
   • Shows habit graph in agenda views

   *Note*: See org-mode documentation for habit repeat patterns and
tracking.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Knowledge [K],  Next: Trash [T],  Prev: Habit [H],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.10 Knowledge [K]
--------------------

*What it is*: Reference information to store for later.

   *When to use it*: When the item is information to keep, not an action
to take.

   *Examples*:
   • Recipe you want to remember
   • Quote from article
   • Meeting notes for reference
   • Product specifications

   *Important*: Choose this AFTER you've properly stored the information
somewhere (your notes system, wiki, etc.).  This just marks the inbox
item as "filed" and archives it.

   *GTD principle*: Separate "stuff to do" from "stuff to know."
Knowledge goes in your reference system, not your action lists.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Trash [T],  Next: Working with the GTD Horizons,  Prev: Knowledge [K],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.11 Trash [T]
----------------

*What it is*: Not actionable, not worth keeping.

   *When to use it*: When you captured something that turns out to be
irrelevant, already done, or not worth pursuing.

   *Examples*:
   • Event that already passed
   • Duplicate of another item

5.3.12 Working with the GTD Horizons
------------------------------------

In GTD, the horizons are defined as such:

Ground
     the day-to-day
Horizon 1
     projects
Horizon 2
     areas of focus
Horizon 3
     1-2 year goals
Horizon 4
     3-5 year vision
Horizon 5
     purpose and principles

   Obviously, Ground and Horizons 1 are handled by the
"capture/clarify/organize/engage" flow we've already seen.

   GTD recommends that you do not start using the horizons above Horizon
1 until you have both Ground and Horizon 1 under control.  So, when you
are ready...

   • Areas of focus

     Horizon 2 is now handled by a variable and a hook you can add to
     ‘org-gtd-organize-hooks’:
        • ‘org-gtd-areas-of-focus’ is a list of strings, each
          representing one of your areas of focus.
        • ‘org-gtd-set-area-of-focus’ is the hook you would add, e.g.
          ‘(setq org-gtd-organize-hooks '(org-gtd-set-area-of-focus))’,
          it ensures each item you clarify will need to be part of a
          horizon.

     You can then use the function ‘org-gtd-reflect-area-of-focus’ to
     generate an agenda view to review a specific area of focus.

     In order to add areas of focus to pre-existing items in your
     system, without going through the clarifying flow, we provide two
     functions:
        • ‘org-gtd-area-of-focus-set-on-item-at-point’, when you are on
          a org heading
        • ‘org-gtd-area-of-focus-set-on-agenda-item’, when you are on an
          agenda item

     Do note that calling the function on item at point will trust you
     blindly to do the right thing, whereas setting the area of focus
     through the agenda will attempt to recognize if you are on a
     project task and thus set the category on the project itself
     instead of the task.

   • Longer-term horizons

     The longer-term horizons can be stored in a file in the
     ‘org-gtd-directory’.  A variable governs the name of the file,
     ‘org-gtd-horizons-file’, by default ‘horizons.org’.

     At the moment it does not seem particularly useful to add any
     automation around these, since they will change so infrequently.

     They are, however, useful to display.

     A variable, ‘org-gtd-clarify-show-horizons’, determines
     whether/where to display the side buffer while clarifying.

     Regardless of the value of this variable, you can use the function
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-toggle-horizons-window’ to display or hide the
     side window.  If the above variable is nil, then the horizons
     window will be toggled on the right side of the screen.

     If your Emacs configuration or distribution doesn't enable
     ‘global-visual-line-mode’ by default, you may consider adding the
     following line at the beginning of the file containing your
     longer-term horizons:

          # -*- eval: (visual-line-mode 1); -*-

     The horizons window is narrow and enabling ‘visual-line-mode’
     locally will make sure that your horizons are easily readable
     during the clarification process.

5.4.2 First Contact: Why Visual Project Management?
---------------------------------------------------

Real projects are rarely simple sequences.  You might have:
   • Tasks that can start simultaneously (parallel research streams)
   • Multiple tasks that must all finish before the next step
     (convergence points)
   • Independent work paths that later merge (diamond patterns)

   Managing these mentally or through text properties is error-prone.
You forget dependencies, create accidental bottlenecks, or miss
opportunities for parallelization.

   *Visual project management solves this.*  You SEE your project as a
dependency graph—boxes for tasks, arrows for dependencies, colors for
states.  Adding tasks, creating dependencies, and understanding project
structure becomes intuitive and immediate.

5.4.3 Black Triangle: Your First Project Graph View
---------------------------------------------------

Let's see this in action right now.

   • Step 1: Find a project

     Open your engage view: ‘C-c d e’

     Find any project task in your agenda (or create a quick test
     project if you don't have one).

   • Step 2: Open the graph view

     Press ‘RET’ on the project task to jump to the project heading.

     Run: ‘M-x org-gtd-show-project-graph’

   • Step 3: Explore

     You're now looking at your project as a visual graph:
        • Tasks are arranged in layers from top to bottom
        • The project heading is at the bottom (it represents the end
          state after all tasks complete)
        • Arrows show which tasks block other tasks
        • Blue boxes are NEXT (ready to work on)
        • Orange boxes are TODO (waiting for dependencies)

     Press ‘?’ to see all available commands.

     *Success!*  You've visualized your first project.  Everything from
     here builds on this.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Understanding Project Dependencies,  Next: Tutorial Parallel Tasks with Graph View,  Prev: Black Triangle Your First Project Graph View,  Up: Working with Projects (Advanced)

5.4.4 Understanding Project Dependencies
----------------------------------------

Before we build complex projects, let's understand how dependencies work
visually.

   • The Dependency Graph (DAG)

     Projects in org-gtd are *Directed Acyclic Graphs* (DAGs):

     *Directed*
          Dependencies have direction.  If Task A blocks Task B, the
          arrow points from A → B.  B can't start until A finishes.

     *Acyclic*
          No circular dependencies.  A → B → C → A would create a
          deadlock.  Org-gtd prevents these automatically.

     *Graph*
          Tasks can have multiple dependencies.  Task C might need both
          A AND B to finish before it can start.

   • What You See in Graph View

     The graph view arranges tasks in *layers*:

        • *Layer 0*: Root tasks (no dependencies, can start immediately)
        • *Layer 1*: Tasks blocked by layer 0
        • *Layer 2*: Tasks blocked by layer 1
        • And so on...

     *Blue boxes* (NEXT state) mean "ready to work on right now."
     *Orange boxes* (TODO state) mean "blocked by dependencies."

     When you complete a NEXT task, org-gtd automatically updates the
     graph:
        • Completed task disappears (or grays out if you keep DONE tasks
          visible)
        • Tasks that were waiting for it may turn blue

   • Sequential vs Parallel vs Mixed

     *Sequential* (default for new projects):
        • Tasks execute one after another: A → B → C
        • Only one task is NEXT at a time
        • Simple, linear workflow

     In graph view, sequential projects look like a vertical chain of
     boxes with arrows flowing downward.

     *Parallel*:
        • Multiple tasks can be NEXT simultaneously
        • Multiple tasks at layer 0 (all root tasks)
        • Faster project completion when tasks are independent

     In graph view, parallel projects have multiple blue boxes at the
     same layer.

     *Mixed* (most real projects):
        • Some tasks parallel, others sequential
        • Example: Research and Planning happen together, but both must
          finish before Building starts

     In graph view, mixed projects show parallel branches that converge
     at join points.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Tutorial Parallel Tasks with Graph View,  Next: Tutorial Complex Dependencies with Graph View,  Prev: Understanding Project Dependencies,  Up: Working with Projects (Advanced)

5.4.5 Tutorial: Parallel Tasks with Graph View
----------------------------------------------

Let's build a project where some tasks happen simultaneously.

   • The Scenario

     You need to "Fix Shoulder Pain":
       1. Find MRI facility (research task)
       2. Make MRI appointment (depends on finding facility)
       3. Make orthopedist appointment (independent research - parallel
          with 1 & 2)
       4. Get diagnosis (depends on both appointments completing)

     Tasks 1 and 3 can happen in parallel—they're independent research
     tasks.

   • Step 1: Capture and Organize

     Capture the project: ‘C-c d c’

          * Fix Shoulder Pain
          ** Find place to get MRI
          ** Make MRI appointment
          ** Make orthopedist appointment
          ** Get diagnosis from orthopedist

     Process the inbox: ‘C-c d p’

     Organize as a project: ‘C-c c’ → ‘[P]’

   • Step 2: Open Graph View

     From the engage view (‘C-c d e’), press ‘RET’ on any task to jump
     to the project.

     Run: ‘M-x org-gtd-show-project-graph’

     You'll see a sequential graph (the default):
          [Fix Shoulder Pain]
                  ↓
          [NEXT: Find place to get MRI]
                  ↓
          [TODO: Make MRI appointment]
                  ↓
          [TODO: Make orthopedist appointment]
                  ↓
          [TODO: Get diagnosis from orthopedist]

     We need to make tasks 1 and 3 parallel.

   • Step 3: Modify Dependencies to Create Parallel Tasks

     We need to make "Make orthopedist appointment" a root task
     (parallel to "Find place to get MRI").

     In graph view, you can modify existing dependencies:

       1. Select "Make orthopedist appointment" in the graph (use
          navigation keys)
       2. Press ‘B’ to modify blockers (remove the blocker that makes it
          sequential)
       3. Press ‘S’ to modify successors (connect it to "Get diagnosis")

     Alternatively, use ‘t r’ to remove a task from the project and
     re-add it where you need it.

   • What Graph View CAN Do

     From the project heading in graph view, press ‘?’ to open the
     command menu:

     ‘r’
          Add a root task (no dependencies, starts immediately)
     ‘s’
          Add a successor (a new task that depends on the selected task)
     ‘b’
          Add a blocker (a new task that the selected task depends on)

     *The key insight:* ‘s’ and ‘b’ let you connect ONE new task to
     MULTIPLE existing tasks using a checkbox menu.  This enables
     complex patterns like convergence (diamond).

   • Building Our Parallel Structure

     Let's build the correct structure from scratch:

       1. Start with project heading selected
       2. ‘r’ → "Find place to get MRI" (root task 1)
       3. ‘r’ → "Make orthopedist appointment" (root task 2 - now
          parallel!)
       4. Select "Find place to get MRI"
       5. ‘s’ → "Make MRI appointment" → check only "Find MRI" → RET
       6. Now select "Make MRI appointment"
       7. ‘s’ → "Get diagnosis"
       8. *Here's the key step:* The checkbox menu shows ALL project
          tasks.  Check BOTH "Make MRI appointment" AND "Make
          orthopedist appointment"
       9. Press ‘RET’ to apply

     Now "Get diagnosis" is blocked by BOTH appointments - a convergence
     point!

   • The Diamond Pattern in Action

     What we just built:

          [Find MRI - NEXT]    [Make Ortho Appt - NEXT]
                  ↓                    ↓
          [Make MRI Appt - TODO]      │
                  ↓                   │
                  └───────┬───────────┘
                          ↓
                 [Get Diagnosis - TODO]

     Two parallel paths converging at "Get diagnosis".  This is the
     diamond pattern.

   • Alternative Approach: Add Blockers

     You could also build this using ‘b’ (add blocker):

       1. Create "Get diagnosis" first as a root task (‘r’)
       2. Select "Get diagnosis"
       3. ‘b’ → "Make MRI appointment" → check "Get diagnosis" → RET
       4. Still on "Get diagnosis", ‘b’ → "Make orthopedist appointment"
          → check "Get diagnosis" → RET
       5. Continue building backwards...

     Both approaches work.  Use whichever feels more natural for your
     mental model.

5.4.6 Tutorial: Complex Dependencies with Graph View
----------------------------------------------------

   • The Scenario

     "Release Next Version of Software":

       1. List features (starting task)
       2. Implement features (depends on list)
       3. Write documentation (can start after list, parallel with
          implement)
       4. Get beta tester feedback (depends on both implement AND
          documentation)
       5. Update code based on feedback (depends on beta feedback)
       6. Update documentation based on feedback (depends on beta
          feedback, parallel with code updates)
       7. Release (depends on both updates completing)

   • The Dependency Graph

          List Features
              ├──→ Implement Features ───┐
              └──→ Write Documentation ───┼──→ Get Beta Feedback
                                          │         ├──→ Update Code ─────┐
                                          │         └──→ Update Docs ──────┼──→ Release
                                          └───────────────────────────────┘

   • Building with Graph View

     Starting from the project heading, open the command menu with ‘?’:

       1. ‘r’ → "List features" (root task)
       2. Select "List features"
       3. ‘s’ → "Implement features" → check "List features" → RET
       4. Go back to "List features"
       5. ‘s’ → "Write documentation" → check "List features" → RET

     Now you have two parallel branches from "List features".

   • Creating the Convergence Point

     For "Get Beta Feedback" that depends on BOTH implement AND
     documentation:

       1. Select "Implement features"
       2. ‘s’ → "Get Beta Feedback"
       3. In the checkbox menu, check BOTH "Implement features" AND
          "Write documentation"
       4. Press ‘RET’

     Now "Get Beta Feedback" has two blockers - it won't become NEXT
     until both are complete.

   • Building the Rest

     Continue building the parallel update paths:

       1. Select "Get Beta Feedback"
       2. ‘s’ → "Update code" → check "Get Beta Feedback" → RET
       3. Select "Get Beta Feedback" again
       4. ‘s’ → "Update docs" → check "Get Beta Feedback" → RET

     For the final convergence at "Release":

       1. Select "Update code"
       2. ‘s’ → "Release"
       3. Check BOTH "Update code" AND "Update docs"
       4. Press ‘RET’

   • The Complete Graph

                     [List Features - NEXT]
                        /              \
                       ↓                ↓
          [Implement - TODO]    [Write Docs - TODO]
                       \                /
                        ↓              ↓
                   [Get Beta Feedback - TODO]
                        /              \
                       ↓                ↓
             [Update Code - TODO]  [Update Docs - TODO]
                        \              /
                         ↓            ↓
                      [Release - TODO]

   • Key Patterns This Example Shows

       1. *Parallel branches* from List Features (using ‘s’ twice from
          same parent)
       2. *Converging paths* at Get Beta Feedback (using multi-select
          checkbox)
       3. *Parallel updates* after feedback (using ‘s’ twice)
       4. *Final convergence* at Release (using multi-select checkbox)

     All four patterns are fully supported.

5.4.7 Common Dependency Patterns (Visual Reference)
---------------------------------------------------

Here's what different patterns look like in graph view:

   • Sequential Chain (A → B → C)

          [A - NEXT]
              ↓
          [B - TODO]
              ↓
          [C - TODO]

     *When to use*: Order matters, each task depends on the previous.

     *How to build*: ‘r’ for A, select A, ‘s’ for B (check A), select B,
     ‘s’ for C (check B).

     *Example*: Review blueprints → Order windows → Schedule carpenter

   • Parallel Independent (A, B, C all start together)

          [A - NEXT]  [B - NEXT]  [C - NEXT]

     *When to use*: Tasks are completely independent, all can start
     immediately.

     *How to build*: From project heading, ‘r’ for each task.

     *Example*: Research destinations, Check budget, Ask for time off
     (vacation planning)

   • Fan-out (A → B, A → C, A → D)

                [A - NEXT]
               /    |    \
              ↓     ↓     ↓
          [B-TODO][C-TODO][D-TODO]

     *When to use*: Initial work enables multiple independent paths.

     *How to build*: ‘r’ for A, select A, then ‘s’ three times (B, C, D
     - each checking only A).

     *Example*: Get project approval → (Design UI, Write backend API,
     Setup infrastructure)

   • Fan-in / Convergence (A → C, B → C)

          [A - NEXT]  [B - NEXT]
                \        /
                 ↓      ↓
                [C - TODO]

     *When to use*: Final task needs all previous work completed.

     *How to build*: ‘r’ for A and B.  Select A, ‘s’ for C, then check
     BOTH A and B in the checkbox menu.

     *Example*: (Write code, Write tests) → Merge to main

   • Diamond (A → B → D, A → C → D)

              [A - NEXT]
               /      \
              ↓        ↓
          [B-TODO] [C-TODO]
              \      /
               ↓    ↓
             [D-TODO]

     *When to use*: Work splits, proceeds in parallel, then combines.

     *How to build*:
       1. ‘r’ for A
       2. Select A, ‘s’ for B (check A)
       3. Select A again, ‘s’ for C (check A)
       4. Select B, ‘s’ for D, then check BOTH B and C

     *Example*: Research → (Write content, Design graphics) → Publish
     article

     *Requires*: Point must be on a project heading (not a task), or
     will prompt for project selection

     *Creates*: Interactive SVG buffer named ‘*Org GTD Graph:
     <project-name>*’

   • Tier 1: Single-Key Commands (Always Available)

     These are the most frequently used commands, available without any
     prefix.

     *Navigation:*

     Key     Command            Description
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     n       Down dependency    Move to a task this one blocks
     p       Up dependency      Move to a task that blocks this one
     TAB     Next sibling       Next sibling task (see ‘org-gtd-graph-sibling-mode’)
     S-TAB   Previous sibling   Previous sibling task
     G       Goto node          Jump to task by name (with completion)

     *What counts as a "sibling"?*  By default, siblings are tasks that
     share at least one blocker (tasks blocked by the same thing).  You
     can customize this with ‘org-gtd-graph-sibling-mode’.  See *note
     Sibling Mode Configuration: org-gtd-graph-sibling-mode.

     *Add Tasks:*

     Key   Command         Description
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     r     Add root task   Create task with no dependencies (starts immediately)
     s     Add successor   Create task that the selected task must complete first
     b     Add blocker     Create task that must complete before selected task

     *Understanding successors and blockers:*

     These two commands handle all dependency relationships:

        • *Add successor* (‘s’): "What comes after this task?"  Creates
          a new task that depends on the selected task.  The selected
          task blocks the new task.

        • *Add blocker* (‘b’): "What must happen first?"  Creates a new
          task that the selected task depends on.  The new task blocks
          the selected task.

     Both commands:
       1. Prompt you to select an existing task OR type a new task title
       2. If creating new: ask whether to clarify/organize it or create
          as simple action
       3. Let you choose multiple edges (which tasks to connect) via
          checkbox menu
       4. Automatically refresh the graph

     *After adding*: Graph automatically refreshes to show new task and
     dependencies.

     *Modify Relationships:*

     Key   Command             Description
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     B     Modify blockers     Toggle which tasks block the selected task
     S     Modify successors   Toggle which tasks the selected task blocks

     These commands open a checkbox menu showing all project tasks.
     Toggle checkboxes to add/remove relationships, then press ‘RET’ to
     apply.

     *View:*

     Key   Command            Description
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     ?     Show menu          Display transient menu with all commands
     g     Refresh            Rebuild graph (use after external changes)
     v     Toggle rendering   Switch between SVG and ASCII rendering
     q     Quit               Close graph view, keep buffer

   • Tier 2: Prefixed Commands

     These commands are used less frequently and use key prefixes for
     organization.

     *Task Operations (‘t’ prefix):*

     Key   Command               Description
     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     t t   Change TODO state     Cycle through TODO states
     t r   Remove from project   Remove task from this project (keeps task)
     t d   Trash task            Mark task canceled and remove from all projects
     t e   Edit in org file      Jump to task in org file for editing
     t i   Show relationships    Display all relationships for selected task

     *Project Operation:*

     Key   Command            Description
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     I     Incubate project   Move entire project to tickler/someday

     *Graph View Operations:*

     Key   Command         Description
     ----------------------------------------------------------
     Q     Quit and kill   Close graph view and kill buffer
     x s   Export SVG      Export graph as SVG file
     x d   Export DOT      Export graph as Graphviz DOT file
     x a   Export ASCII    Export graph as ASCII text file

   • Visual Indicators

        • *Blue boxes*: NEXT tasks (ready to work on)
        • *Orange boxes*: TODO tasks (blocked by dependencies)
        • *Arrows*: Dependencies (from blocker → blocked task)
        • *Layers*: Vertical positioning shows dependency depth

   • Operations Not Available in Graph View

     Some operations are standard org-mode functionality and must be
     done in the org file:

     *Changing task properties*:
        • TODO state: Use ‘t t’ in graph view, or ‘C-c C-t’ in org file
        • Deadlines/schedules: ‘C-c C-d’, ‘C-c C-s’ in org file
        • Task title/description: edit in org file
        • Tags/properties: edit in org file

     *Task removal*: Use ‘t r’ to remove a task from the project (keeps
     task) or ‘t d’ to trash it (marks canceled).  Completed tasks still
     show in graph view to maintain project history.

     *Access org file*: Press ‘RET’ on any task in graph view to jump to
     it in the org file.

   • Text-Based Alternatives

     Most users will find the graph view intuitive for dependency
     management.  However, DWIM (Do What I Mean) commands work from any
     context (org buffer, agenda, or graph view):

        • ‘org-gtd-project-add-successor’ - Add a task that depends on
          current task
        • ‘org-gtd-project-add-blocker’ - Add a task that blocks current
          task
        • ‘org-gtd-project-add-root-task’ - Add a task with no
          dependencies
        • ‘org-gtd-project-remove-task’ - Remove task from project
          (keeps task)
        • ‘org-gtd-project-trash-task’ - Remove and cancel task
        • ‘org-gtd-project-change-state’ - Change TODO state

     For lower-level dependency manipulation:

        • ‘org-gtd-task-add-blockers’ - Add blockers via text interface
        • ‘org-gtd-task-remove-blockers’ - Remove blockers via text
          interface
        • ‘org-gtd-task-show-relationships’ - Display relationships in
          minibuffer
        • ‘org-gtd-validate-project-dependencies’ - Validate project
          structure

     See *note Task Dependency Commands:: for details.

5.4.9 Graph Rendering Modes
---------------------------

The graph view supports two rendering modes that you can toggle between
at any time.  Configure the default mode with
‘org-gtd-graph-render-mode’.

   • SVG Mode (Default)

     High-quality graphical rendering with:
        • Smooth curves for dependency arrows
        • Anti-aliased text
        • Visual polish
        • Larger display area
        • Better for GUI Emacs

     Set as default with:
          (setq org-gtd-graph-render-mode 'svg)

   • ASCII Mode

     Text-based rendering using box-drawing characters:
        • Works in terminal Emacs
        • Accessible for screen readers
        • Compact display
        • No external dependencies
        • Uses Unicode box-drawing glyphs

     Set as default with:
          (setq org-gtd-graph-render-mode 'ascii)

   • Toggling Modes

     Press ‘v’ while in graph view to toggle between SVG and ASCII
     rendering.

   • Troubleshooting ASCII Rendering

     If ASCII rendering looks broken:
        • Ensure your terminal supports UTF-8 box-drawing characters
        • Try SVG mode (‘v’ to toggle)
        • Check that your font supports box-drawing glyphs
        • Verify ‘(char-displayable-p ?│)’ returns ‘t’

5.4.11 Auto-Refresh on File Changes
-----------------------------------

Graph view automatically watches the org file and refreshes when changes
are detected (with 300ms debounce).  This means:

   • Changes in the org file appear in graph view automatically
   • No need to manually refresh after external edits
   • Multiple graph views of the same project stay in sync
   • File watching is buffer-local and cleaned up on quit

   You can still manually refresh with ‘g’ if needed.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Technical Details,  Next: Practical Tips for Project Management,  Prev: Auto-Refresh on File Changes,  Up: Working with Projects (Advanced)

5.4.12 Technical Details
------------------------

   • Graph Data Structure

     Projects are represented as *Directed Acyclic Graphs* (DAGs):

        • *Directed*: Dependencies have direction (A blocks B, not vice
          versa)
        • *Acyclic*: No circular dependencies (org-gtd prevents these)
        • *Graph*: Tasks can have multiple blockers and multiple
          dependents

   • Layout Algorithm

     The Sugiyama layout algorithm:
       1. Assigns tasks to layers based on dependency depth
       2. Minimizes edge crossings between layers
       3. Centers nodes horizontally for visual balance
       4. Calculates smooth curved arrows (SVG) or line-drawing
          characters (ASCII)

   • Properties Used

     Graph view reads and writes these org properties:

        • ‘ORG_GTD_FIRST_TASKS’ (on project heading): Space-separated
          list of task IDs with no dependencies
        • ‘ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON’ (on tasks): Space-separated list of task
          IDs this task depends on
        • ‘ORG_GTD_BLOCKS’ (on tasks): Space-separated list of task IDs
          this task blocks
        • ‘ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS’ (on tasks): Space-separated list of
          project IDs this task belongs to

     These properties maintain bidirectional consistency.  When you add
     dependency A→B:
        • A's ‘ORG_GTD_BLOCKS’ includes B's ID
        • B's ‘ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON’ includes A's ID

     You typically don't edit these properties directly—use graph view
     commands or the text-based alternatives.

   • Undo/Redo Support

     Currently, undo/redo is not implemented in graph view.  Graph
     modifications are immediately saved to the org file.

     To undo changes:
        • Switch to the org file buffer
        • Use ‘C-x u’ (undo) as normal
        • The graph view will auto-refresh to show the reverted state

5.4.13 Practical Tips for Project Management
--------------------------------------------

   • When to Use Graph View

        • *Planning complex projects*: Visualize before committing to
          structure
        • *Understanding stuck projects*: See why tasks are blocked
        • *Weekly review*: Quick visual health check of all projects
        • *Adding tasks mid-project*: Add with correct dependencies
          immediately

   • When to Use Sequential (Default)

        • Order truly matters (can't install before purchasing)
        • You're unsure what the next task will be until you complete
          current one
        • The project is simple (3-4 tasks)
        • You don't want to think about dependencies

     *Just organize as project* (‘C-c c’ → ‘[P]’) and you're done.

   • When to Create Parallel Structures

        • You have multiple people working on the project
        • Tasks are independent and could be done in any order
        • You want to optimize for speed
        • You know all tasks upfront

     *Use ‘r’ multiple times* from graph view to create parallel roots.

   • Managing Complexity

        • *Start sequential, add parallel only when needed*: Don't
          over-engineer.
        • *Use graph view to understand before modifying*: Visualize
          first.
        • *Keep task names clear and specific*: "Research venues" not
          "Research"
        • *Review stuck projects weekly*: ‘M-x
          org-gtd-reflect-stuck-projects’

   • Growing Projects Over Time

     As projects evolve, you need to add tasks:

        • *New independent work stream*: ‘r’ (add root task)
        • *Next step in sequence*: Select current task, ‘s’ (add
          successor)
        • *Prerequisite for existing task*: Select existing task, ‘b’
          (add blocker)

     After adding, the graph refreshes automatically.

5.4.14 Exporting Project Graphs
-------------------------------

   • First Contact: What is Graph Export?

     Graph export saves your project visualization as a file.  Share
     project plans with teammates who don't use Emacs.  Include project
     graphs in presentations or documentation.  Process graphs with
     external tools like Graphviz.

     Three export formats:
        • *SVG*: High-quality graphics for documents and presentations
        • *DOT*: Graphviz source for custom styling and layouts
        • *ASCII*: Text-based diagrams for terminals and plain-text
          documentation

     Who needs this?  Anyone collaborating outside Emacs, creating
     documentation, or using graph analysis tools.

   • Tutorial: Export Your First Graph

     Let's export a project graph in under 30 seconds:

       1. Open any project in graph view: ‘M-x
          org-gtd-show-project-graph’
       2. Press ‘?’ to open the command menu
       3. Press ‘E s’ to export as SVG
       4. Choose a filename (e.g., ‘project-plan.svg’)
       5. Done!  Open the file in any image viewer or web browser

     The exported graph preserves your current view, including which
     task is selected (highlighted).

   • Progressive Learning: Choosing Export Formats

     **Start with SVG** when you first need to export.  It works
     everywhere—documents, presentations, web pages, email attachments.
     Your colleague can open it in any browser.

     **Use DOT when you need control**.  The DOT format is Graphviz's
     source language.  Export to DOT when you want to:
        • Change colors, fonts, or layout algorithms
        • Combine multiple project graphs
        • Generate different output formats (PNG, PDF, PostScript)
        • Integrate with automated build systems

     Process a DOT file with Graphviz:
          dot -Tpng project.dot -o project.png      # Convert to PNG
          dot -Tpdf project.dot -o project.pdf      # Convert to PDF
          neato -Tsvg project.dot -o custom.svg     # Different layout algorithm

     **Use ASCII for text contexts**.  ASCII export creates
     terminal-friendly diagrams.  Use when:
        • Writing plain-text documentation (README files)
        • Sharing in chat or email where images don't work
        • Reviewing projects over SSH without graphics
        • Creating quick diagrams for code comments

     Example ASCII output:
          Conference Planning
          ├─ Research venues
          ├─ Create budget
          │  └─ Get quotes
          └─ Book venue

     **Handling large projects**: All formats work with complex graphs,
     but consider:
        • SVG scales perfectly (zoom without quality loss)
        • DOT can be processed with different layout algorithms for
          readability
        • ASCII may become unwieldy with 20+ tasks (switch to SVG)

   • When Exports Differ from Display

     The export reflects your current graph state.  If you've selected a
     task (navigated with ‘j~/~k’ or clicked), that task appears
     highlighted in the export.

     To export without highlighting:
       1. Press ‘ESC’ to deselect the current task
       2. Export with ‘E s’, ‘E d’, or ‘E a’
       3. The export shows all tasks unhighlighted

     Changes you make in graph view are immediately saved to the org
     file, so exports always reflect the actual project structure.

   • Reference: Export Commands

     From graph view (‘M-x org-gtd-show-project-graph’), use the ‘x’
     prefix:

     Key     Command                        Format   Best For
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     ‘x s’   ‘org-gtd-graph-export-svg’     SVG      Documents, presentations, sharing
     ‘x d’   ‘org-gtd-graph-export-dot’     DOT      Graphviz processing, customization
     ‘x a’   ‘org-gtd-graph-export-ascii’   ASCII    Terminals, plain-text docs

     All commands prompt for a filename.  The file is created
     immediately.

   • Troubleshooting Exports

     **"No graph to export" error**: You must be in a graph view buffer.
     Open a project graph first with ‘M-x org-gtd-show-project-graph’.

     **Empty or corrupted file**:
        • Verify the graph displays correctly before exporting
        • Press ‘g’ to refresh the graph view
        • Try exporting to a different location with write permissions

     **SVG won't open in browser**: Ensure the filename ends in ‘.svg’.
     Most programs detect format by file extension.

     **DOT processing fails**: Install Graphviz (‘dot’ command) on your
     system.  The DOT file is plain text—open it in any editor to verify
     its contents.

5.4.15 Troubleshooting Projects with Graph View
-----------------------------------------------

   • Project is Stuck (has TODO tasks but no NEXT)

     Run ‘M-x org-gtd-reflect-stuck-projects’ to find stuck projects.

     Open the stuck project in graph view: ‘M-x
     org-gtd-show-project-graph’

     *What to look for*:
        • *No blue boxes?*  All tasks might be waiting for dependencies
          that are DONE.  Press ‘g’ to refresh.
        • *Orange boxes at layer 0?*  These should be blue (root tasks
          are never blocked).  Something's wrong with the dependency
          structure.
        • *Circular dependency?*  Org-gtd prevents these, but if you see
          arrows forming a loop, you've found a bug.

     *How to fix*:
        • Use graph view to understand the structure
        • Add a new root task (‘r’) if nothing can start
        • Refresh (‘g’) after any changes

   • Task Should Be NEXT But Shows as TODO

     In graph view, look at the task:
        • Is it orange (TODO)?
        • Trace arrows pointing TO it—these are its blockers
        • Are all those blockers blue?  Then something's wrong.
        • Are some blockers orange?  Then the task is correctly blocked.

     If blockers are actually DONE but still showing as blue, press ‘g’
     to refresh.

     *How to fix*: Use ‘B’ to modify blockers (uncheck incorrect ones),
     or use text command ‘org-gtd-task-clear-relationships’ to start
     fresh.

   • Too Many Tasks Are NEXT

     In graph view:
        • Count blue boxes
        • If you have 10+ blue tasks, you probably have dependency
          problems
        • Some tasks should depend on others but don't

     *How to fix*:
        • Select a task that should be blocked
        • Press ‘B’ to modify its blockers
        • Or use ‘s’ from an earlier task to add a successor that should
          come later

   • Graph Won't Open

     If ‘M-x org-gtd-show-project-graph’ doesn't work:

        • Verify you're on a project heading (not a task heading)
        • Check that the heading has ‘ORG_GTD’ property set to
          "Projects"
        • Try explicitly: ‘M-x org-gtd-show-project-graph’
        • Check for errors in ‘*Messages*’ buffer

   • Graph Shows No Tasks

     If the graph opens but shows no tasks:

        • Check if the project has subtasks (tasks should be subheadings
          under the project)
        • Verify tasks have ‘ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS’ property containing
          the project ID
        • Press ‘g’ to force a complete refresh
        • Check ‘*Messages*’ buffer for parsing errors

   • Task Shows Wrong State (NEXT vs TODO)

     If a task's color doesn't match its expected state:

        • Press ‘g’ to refresh (state might be stale from external
          edits)
        • Check the task's actual TODO state in the org file (press ‘e’
          to jump there)
        • Verify dependencies are correct (press ‘i’ to inspect
          relationships)
        • Look for completed tasks that haven't been refreshed

   • Can't Modify Dependencies

     If modification commands don't work:

        • Ensure a task is selected (should see highlighted box)
        • Press ‘?’ to verify commands are available in the transient

5.4.17 Tickler Projects: Pausing Work You're Not Ready For
----------------------------------------------------------

   • First Contact: Why Tickler Projects?

     You're managing 15 active projects.  Some are ready to work on NOW.
     Others are good ideas, but wrong timing—maybe you're waiting for
     budget approval, or team availability, or just aren't ready to
     commit yet.

     Keeping them all visible in your engage view creates noise.  You
     scan past 10 "someday" projects to find the 5 you can actually work
     on today.  That's cognitive load you don't need.

     *Tickler projects solve this.*  Pause a project with a review date.
     It disappears from your engage view, your NEXT lists,
     everywhere—but preserves the complete project structure (all tasks,
     dependencies, planning work).  When the review date arrives or
     you're ready, reactivate it with one command.  The project springs
     back to life exactly as you left it.

     For GTD users managing multiple projects where some need to be
     dormant temporarily with a specific return date.

   • Black Triangle: Tickler Your First Project in 30 Seconds

     Let's tickler a project right now.

     *Step 1: Find a project you're not ready for*

     Open graph view for any project: ‘M-x org-gtd-show-project-graph’

     Or navigate to any project heading in your GTD file.

     *Step 2: Tickler it*

     Press ‘I’ in graph view, or run ‘M-x org-gtd-tickler’

     Enter a review date when prompted: ‘2025-06-01’

     *Step 3: Verify it's gone*

     Open your engage view: ‘C-c d e’

     The project's tasks are GONE from your NEXT list.  No clutter.

     *Step 4: Check your review date*

     The tickler project will appear in your agenda on 2025-06-01 as a
     reminder to reconsider it.

     *Success!*  You've paused a project without losing any of your
     planning work.

   • Understanding Tickler: What Actually Happens

     When you tickler a project, org-gtd performs several operations to
     make it completely invisible while preserving state:

     *State Preservation*

     For the project heading and every task:
        • Current ‘ORG_GTD’ property → saved to ‘PREVIOUS_ORG_GTD’
          (e.g., "Projects" → "Projects")
        • Current TODO keyword → saved to ‘PREVIOUS_TODO’ property
          (e.g., "NEXT" → "NEXT")
        • ‘ORG_GTD’ property → set to "Tickler"
        • TODO keyword → cleared completely (becomes nil)

     **Why clear keywords?**  This makes tickler tasks invisible to all
     views naturally.  Your engage view shows ~(todo .  "NEXT")~—tasks
     with no keywords don't match, so they disappear automatically.

     *Review Date Storage*

     The review date is stored in the project heading's
     ‘ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP’ property as ‘<2025-06-01>’.  This makes the
     project appear in your org-agenda on that date, just like delegated
     items or calendar events.

     *Dependency Preservation*

     ALL dependency relationships (‘ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON’,
     ‘ORG_GTD_BLOCKS’) remain intact.  They're dormant—they don't affect
     anything while in tickler—but they're there.  When you reactivate,
     dependencies work exactly as before.

     *Multi-Project Tasks*

     If a task belongs to MULTIPLE projects (has multiple IDs in
     ‘ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS’), it is NOT tickler'd.  Why?  Because it's
     still needed by other active projects.

     You'll see: "Skipping multi-project task: Task Name"

     The task remains active with its TODO keyword intact.

   • Tutorial: Managing Seasonal Projects

     Let's walk through a realistic scenario: you have annual projects
     that you only work on during specific seasons.

     *The Problem*

     You're tracking these projects:
        • "Annual Review Process" (only relevant December-January)
        • "Summer Conference Planning" (only relevant May-August)
        • "Q4 Budget Proposals" (only relevant September-November)

     It's March.  None of these are relevant, but they clutter your
     project list and NEXT tasks keep appearing in your engage view.

     *The Solution: Tickler Until Needed*

     In March, tickler all three:

       1. Navigate to "Summer Conference Planning"
       2. ‘M-x org-gtd-tickler’
       3. Review date: ‘2025-05-01’
       4. Repeat for other seasonal projects with appropriate dates

     Your engage view is now clean—only projects you can work on THIS
     MONTH.

     *When Review Dates Arrive*

     On May 1st, "Summer Conference Planning" appears in your agenda:

          Tuesday 1 May 2025
            Summer Conference Planning (review tickler project)

     Options:
        • *Ready to activate?*  Press ‘RET’ to jump to it, then ‘M-x
          org-gtd-reactivate’
        • *Still not ready?*  Leave it in tickler, or run
          ‘org-gtd-tickler’ again with a later date

     *Reactivation Details*

     When you run ‘org-gtd-reactivate’:

       1. State restoration happens automatically:
             • ‘PREVIOUS_ORG_GTD’ → ‘ORG_GTD’ (Tickler → Projects)
             • ‘PREVIOUS_TODO’ → TODO keywords restored
             • ‘ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP’ removed (no longer in agenda)

       2. Dependency recalculation runs:
             • ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords’ examines all
               dependencies
             • Tasks with satisfied dependencies → marked NEXT
             • Tasks still blocked → remain TODO

       3. Project graph opens automatically:
             • Review the project structure
             • Verify NEXT/TODO states make sense
             • Adjust dependencies with ‘B’ (modify blockers) or ‘S’
               (modify dependents)

   • Common Patterns and Scenarios

     *Pattern: "Not Now, But Someday"*

     Project ideas that might happen eventually:

          "Rewrite legacy authentication system"
          "Migrate to new CRM platform"
          "Redesign company website"

     *Strategy:*
        • Tickler with a FAR future date (2026-01-01)
        • Or use quarterly review dates (2025-07-01, 2025-10-01, etc.)
        • When review arrives, ask: "Is this the right time?"  If no,
          tickler again for next quarter

     *Pattern: "Waiting for External Factor"*

     Projects blocked by external dependencies:

          "Launch new product" (waiting for legal approval)
          "Office redesign" (waiting for budget committee meeting on May 15th)
          "Implement new API" (waiting for vendor release)

     *Strategy:*
        • Tickler with review date = when you expect the blocker to
          clear
        • Add note in project heading: "Tickler because: waiting for
          budget approval"
        • When reactivated, first task might be "Check if budget was
          approved"

     *Pattern: "Quarterly Batch Projects"*

     Projects you tackle in batches:

          "Review expenses" (quarterly)
          "Update documentation" (quarterly)
          "Audit security" (quarterly)

     *Strategy:*
        • After completing Q1 batch, tickler with Q2 start date
        • Review dates: 2025-04-01, 2025-07-01, 2025-10-01, 2026-01-01
        • Consistent rhythm without manual tracking

     *Pattern: "Collaborative Project, Waiting for Team"*

     Project requires specific people who aren't available:

          "Marketing campaign redesign" (designer on vacation until June)
          "Code refactoring sprint" (waiting for team to finish current release)

     *Strategy:*
        • Tickler with return/availability date
        • In project heading, note: "Tickler: waiting for Sarah (back
          June 10th)"
        • Reactivate when team is available, project structure intact

   • Advanced: External Dependencies and Warnings

     *What Are External Dependencies?*

     Imagine:
        • Project A has "Task A1: Research vendor options"
        • Project B (separate project) has "Task B1: Evaluate vendors"
          that depends on Task A1 completing

     Task B1 has an *external dependency*—it depends on a task from a
     different project.

     *What Happens When Tickler'ing*

     If you tickler Project A, org-gtd warns you:

          External tasks depend on this project:
            - Task B1: Evaluate vendors (in Project B)

          Continue tickler? (y/n)

     **Why warn?**  Tickler'ing Project A clears Task A1's TODO keyword.
     Task B1 is still expecting Task A1 to be NEXT or TODO.  This
     creates a "dangling reference"—B1 is blocked by a task that doesn't
     exist in active work anymore.

     **Your options:**

       1. *Cancel tickler* (‘n’): Don't tickler Project A yet.  Maybe
          restructure dependencies first.

       2. *Continue anyway* (‘y’): Accept that Task B1 will stay
          TODO/blocked until you reactivate Project A.  Make a note in
          Project B about this.

       3. *Remove the dependency*: Before tickler'ing, use graph view to
          remove the B1 → A1 dependency link.  Decide if B1 should
          proceed independently.

     *Real-World Example*

     You're planning a conference (Project Conference) with these tasks:
        • Book venue
        • Invite speakers
        • Set up registration

     A separate project (Project Marketing) has:
        • "Design conference branding" → depends on "Book venue" (need
          venue details for design)

     If you tickler Project Conference (venue not booked yet, conference
     might not happen), the warning shows you that Marketing's branding
     task will be stuck.

     *Decision:* You might realize the branding task should just wait in
     Project Marketing with a note "start when conference is confirmed",
     rather than having a hard dependency.  Remove the link before
     tickler'ing.

   • Technical Details: How Tickler Works Under the Hood

     *Property-Based State Management*

     Tickler uses properties, not file movement.  The project and its
     tasks stay in the same file, same location.  Only properties
     change:

     Before tickler (Task 1 of a project):
          *** NEXT Task 1: Research options
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ID: task-1-id
          :ORG_GTD: Actions
          :ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS: project-id
          :ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON:
          :ORG_GTD_BLOCKS: task-2-id
          :END:

     After tickler:
          *** Task 1: Research options
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ID: task-1-id
          :ORG_GTD: Tickler
          :PREVIOUS_ORG_GTD: Actions
          :PREVIOUS_TODO: NEXT
          :ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS: project-id
          :ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON:
          :ORG_GTD_BLOCKS: task-2-id
          :END:

     Note:
        • TODO keyword cleared (was NEXT, now nothing)
        • ‘ORG_GTD’ changed to "Tickler"
        • Original values saved in ‘PREVIOUS_*’ properties
        • Dependencies (‘ORG_GTD_BLOCKS’) preserved unchanged

     *View Filtering Mechanism*

     Why don't tickler tasks appear in views?

     Most views filter by TODO keywords: ‘(todo . "NEXT")’, ‘(todo .
     "TODO|NEXT|WAIT")’, etc.

     Since tickler tasks have NO TODO keyword (cleared to nil), they
     don't match these filters.  Natural exclusion.

     For area-of-focus reviews that show projects, we filter: ‘(and
     (property "ORG_GTD" "Projects") (property "CATEGORY" "Work"))’

     Tickler projects have ‘(property "ORG_GTD" "Tickler")’ instead of
     "Projects", so they appear in a separate "Tickler projects"
     section.

     *Reactivation Dependency Recalculation*

     When you reactivate, here's the exact sequence:

       1. *Restore properties* (for project heading + all tasks):
             • ‘PREVIOUS_ORG_GTD’ → ‘ORG_GTD’
             • ‘PREVIOUS_TODO’ → TODO keyword
             • Delete ‘PREVIOUS_*’ properties
             • Delete ‘ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP’

       2. *Recalculate NEXT/TODO states*:
             • Call ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords’
             • This traverses the dependency graph breadth-first
             • For each task: if ALL dependencies are DONE/CNCL → mark
               NEXT
             • Otherwise → mark TODO

       3. *Open graph view* (if interactive):
             • Shows the reactivated project visually
             • User can verify states, adjust dependencies
             • Immediate feedback on project structure

     **Why recalculate?**  You might have manually edited the project
     while in tickler—added tasks, changed dependencies, marked some
     DONE.  Recalculation ensures consistent state.

     *Multi-Project Task Detection*

     The check:
          (let ((project-ids (org-entry-get-multivalued-property
                               (point) "ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS")))
            (if (> (length project-ids) 1)
                ;; Skip this task - belongs to multiple projects
                (message "Skipping multi-project task: %s" (org-get-heading))
              ;; Normal tickler
              ...))

     If ‘ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS’ contains ‘"project-a project-b"’ (two
     IDs), the task belongs to both projects.  Tickler'ing one project
     shouldn't hide the task—it's still needed by the other project.

   • Troubleshooting Tickler

     *Tasks Still Showing After Tickler'ing Project*

     *Symptom:* You tickler'd a project, but some of its tasks still
     appear in your engage view.

     *Diagnosis:* Check if those tasks belong to multiple projects:
       1. Navigate to the task
       2. ‘C-c C-x p’ (show properties)
       3. Look at ‘ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS’ value
       4. If it has multiple IDs (space-separated), the task is shared

     *Solution:* This is expected behavior.  Multi-project tasks remain
     active because other projects need them.  Options:
        • Tickler ALL projects the task belongs to (task will then be
          tickler'd)
        • Remove the task from one of the projects first
        • Accept that the task stays visible (it's genuinely active in
          another project)

     *Tickler Project Doesn't Appear on Review Date*

     *Symptom:* Review date arrived (e.g., June 1st), but the project
     doesn't show in your agenda.

     *Diagnosis:*
       1. Navigate to the project heading
       2. Check for ‘ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP’ property
       3. Verify format is ‘<2025-06-01>’ (angle brackets, YYYY-MM-DD)
       4. Check your org-agenda-files includes the GTD file

     *Solution:*
        • If property is missing: tickler again with a date
        • If format is wrong: manually fix to ‘<YYYY-MM-DD>’
        • If file not in agenda: ‘M-x org-agenda-file-to-front’ while in
          the GTD file

     *Reactivated Project Has Wrong NEXT/TODO States*

     *Symptom:* After reactivating, tasks that should be NEXT are
     showing as TODO, or vice versa.

     *Diagnosis:* Open graph view (‘M-x org-gtd-show-project-graph’):
        • Trace arrows (dependencies)
        • Check if dependencies are actually DONE
        • Look for tasks with cleared keywords that should have keywords

     *Solution:*
        • Press ‘g’ to refresh and recalculate states
        • If recalculation doesn't fix it: dependencies might be
          incorrect
        • Use ‘B’ to modify blockers, then ‘g’ to recalculate

     *Can't Reactivate: "Not Tickler" Error*

     *Symptom:* Running ‘org-gtd-reactivate’ gives error: "Item at point
     is not tickler"

     *Diagnosis:* Check the ‘ORG_GTD’ property:
       1. ‘C-c C-x p’ to show properties
       2. Look for ‘ORG_GTD’ value
       3. Should be "Tickler"

     *Solution:*
        • If ‘ORG_GTD’ is something else (e.g., "Projects"): it's not in
          tickler, nothing to reactivate
        • If manually edited: set ‘ORG_GTD’ back to "Tickler" or just
          manually restore the state
        • If ‘PREVIOUS_*’ properties are missing: you'll need to
          manually set states

5.4.18 Project Progress Cookies: See Your Progress at a Glance
--------------------------------------------------------------

   • First Contact: What Are Progress Cookies?

     Progress cookies show how far along your project is: ‘[3/7][42%]’
     means 3 of 7 tasks done.

     They appear directly on project headings, so you can scan your
     project list and instantly know which projects are nearly complete,
     which are just starting, and which might need attention.

     *Who needs this?*  Anyone managing multiple projects who wants
     quick visual feedback without opening each project to count tasks.

   • Black Triangle: See Progress in 30 Seconds

     Your projects already have progress cookies—they're enabled by
     default.

       1. Open your engage view: ‘C-c d e’
       2. Find any project task
       3. Press ‘RET’ to jump to the project heading

     You'll see something like:

          * PROJ Buy a house [0/5][0%]                      :home:

     That's it.  The ‘[0/5][0%]’ shows 0 of 5 tasks completed.

   • Tutorial: Watch Cookies Update Automatically

     Let's see progress cookies in action:

       1. *Find a project with tasks:*
             • Open engage view: ‘C-c d e’
             • Navigate to a project task, press ‘RET’ to go to the
               project heading
             • Note the current cookie: ‘[0/3][0%]’ (or similar)

       2. *Complete a task:*
             • Find a NEXT task in that project
             • Mark it done: ‘C-c C-t DONE’ (or cycle to DONE)

       3. *Check the project heading:*
             • Scroll up to the project heading
             • The cookie updated: ‘[1/3][33%]’

     No manual refresh needed.  Complete tasks, cookies update
     automatically.

   • Understanding How Cookies Work

     **What gets counted?**

     Progress cookies count all tasks linked to the project via
     ‘ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS’.  This is different from org-mode's built-in
     ‘[/]’ cookies which only count direct children.

     Why does this matter?  In org-gtd v4, projects are DAGs (directed
     acyclic graphs)—tasks can live anywhere in your GTD files and link
     to projects by ID.  The cookie counts ALL linked tasks, regardless
     of where they're located in your files.

     **When do cookies update?**

        • *Task state changes:* Complete a task → cookie updates
          immediately
        • *Project creation:* New projects get cookies automatically
        • *Manual refresh:* ‘M-x org-gtd-project-update-all-cookies’
          refreshes everything
        • *Fix TODO keywords:* ‘M-x
          org-gtd-projects-fix-all-todo-keywords’ also refreshes cookies

   • Configuring Cookie Position

     Control where cookies appear with
     ‘org-gtd-project-progress-cookie-position’:

          ;; At end of heading, before tags (default)
          (setq org-gtd-project-progress-cookie-position 'end)

          ;; After TODO keyword, before title
          (setq org-gtd-project-progress-cookie-position 'start)

          ;; Disable cookies entirely
          (setq org-gtd-project-progress-cookie-position nil)

     Visual comparison:

          ;; 'end (default):
          * PROJ Buy a house [3/7][42%]                    :home:

          ;; 'start:
          * PROJ [3/7][42%] Buy a house                    :home:

          ;; nil:
          * PROJ Buy a house                               :home:

   • Common Scenarios

     **Cookies look wrong after external edits**

     You edited tasks outside org-gtd (mobile app, manual edit) and
     cookies don't match reality.

     *Fix:* ‘M-x org-gtd-project-update-all-cookies’

     This scans all projects and recalculates from scratch.

     **Want to disable cookies for performance**

     If you have hundreds of projects and notice slowness:

          (setq org-gtd-project-progress-cookie-position nil)

     Cookies won't update or display.

     **Cookies showing 0/0**

     This means no tasks are linked to the project.  Either:
        • The project has no tasks yet (add some)
        • Tasks don't have ‘ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS’ pointing to this
          project (check properties)

   • Technical Reference

     **Format:** ‘[completed/total][percent%]’

     **Calculation:** Scans all headings with ‘ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS’
     matching the project's ID.  Counts tasks with TODO keyword in
     ‘org-done-keywords’ as completed.

     **Storage:** Actual text on the heading (not computed at display
     time).  This means cookies persist and are visible even in
     non-Emacs editors.

     **Hook:** ‘org-after-todo-state-change-hook’ triggers recalculation
     when task states change.

     **Related commands:**
     ‘org-gtd-project-update-all-cookies’
          Refresh all project cookies
     ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-all-todo-keywords’
          Fixes keywords AND refreshes cookies

5.4.19 Cleaning up / archiving completed work
---------------------------------------------

Doing this without user intervention is tricky, as it makes undoing
actions more complicated.  As such, Org GTD provides a function that
will go through the ‘org-gtd-directory’ files, find the headings that
belong to Org GTD (see *note Refiling to the appropriate area::), and
archive the finished items.

   The variable ‘org-gtd-archive-location’ points to a *function* that
returns a string matching the ‘org-archive-location’ definition.  It is
a function in order to allow the filename to be dynamic.

   The function to archive everything is ‘M-x
org-gtd-archive-completed-items’.

5.4.20 Commands you can call on org-agenda
------------------------------------------

Since Org provides the agenda, it is a convenient base of operations for
interacting with things that come up through ‘org-gtd-engage’.

   Here are the actions available to you:

‘M-x org-gtd-delegate-agenda-item’
     When the point is on an action, this will properly delegate the
     action to someone else.
‘M-x org-gtd-project-cancel-from-agenda’
     When the point is on a project action, this command will cancel the
     remaining actions in the project.
‘M-x org-gtd-clarify-agenda-item’
     If you would like to clarify and organize an item through the
     agenda view, for whatever reason, this is your entry point.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Defining your own agenda views,  Next: Adding your own hooks when organizing,  Prev: Commands you can call on org-agenda,  Up: Working with Projects (Advanced)

5.4.21 Defining your own agenda views
-------------------------------------

You can define your own agenda views by defining functions with custom
agenda commands.  As long as you have ‘org-gtd-directory’ in your
‘org-agenda-files’ (required for org-gtd to work), your views will
include GTD items automatically.

     (defun my-agenda ()
       (let ((org-agenda-custom-commands '(your-definition-here)))
         (org-agenda nil "x")))

   Where ‘x’ is whatever your defined key is.

   *See also*: For a much easier way to create custom views, see *note
View DSL Filter Reference::, which provides a declarative language for
defining views without writing skip functions.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Adding your own hooks when organizing,  Prev: Defining your own agenda views,  Up: Working with Projects (Advanced)

5.4.22 Adding your own hooks when organizing
--------------------------------------------

Adding useful metadata to the tasks allows you to enhance the agenda
view to make it more useful to you, whether it be effort, tags,
priority, or any other amount of information you might like.

   This being said, different types of tasks or items are not even
created equal.  For instance, there may be metadata you want to add to a
project heading but not its tasks, or to a calendar item and not to a
trash item.

   Org GTD therefore provides a helper function,
‘org-gtd-organize-type-member-p’, which you can use when creating your
own hooks.  The function takes one argument, a list of types (provided
in the function's documentation).  When called as part of a hook, this
function will check a buffer-local variable called
‘org-gtd--organize-type’, managed by Org GTD, to determine truthiness.

   For an example, see the source code for
‘org-gtd-areas-of-focus--set’, which will not run if the task being
organized is a project task, trash, knowledge, or a quick action.

   *See also*: For complete documentation on the hooks framework,
including many examples and best practices, see *note Hooks Framework
Reference::.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Automating through emacs,  Prev: Working with Projects (Advanced),  Up: Using Org GTD

5.5 Automating through emacs
============================

There's now a few functions you can use when you are doing work within
emacs and would like GTD to track something for you as a result:
   • ‘org-gtd-habit-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-calendar-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-delegate-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-tickler-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-someday-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-single-action-create’

   See the documentation for each, but suffice it to say they all take,
at the very least, a string that will be used as the text part of the
org heading that gets stored in org-gtd.

   For instance, one way this could work:

     (defun org-gtd-email-reminder ()
       (let ((topic (message-fetch-field "subject"))
             (delegated-to (message-fetch-field "to"))
             (reminder-date (org-read-date nil nil "+3d")))
         (org-gtd-delegate-create (format "Reminder: %s" topic)
                                  delegated-to
                                  reminder-date)))

     (add-hook 'message-send-hook 'org-gtd-email-reminder)

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Required Configuration,  Next: Directory and File Configuration,  Up: Configuration Variables Reference

6.1.1 Required Configuration
----------------------------

   • ‘org-todo-keywords’ (org-mode variable)

     *Type*: List of keyword sequences

     *Default*: Varies by org-mode installation

     *Description*: Defines TODO keyword sequences for org-mode.  All
     GTD keywords must be in the *same sequence*.

     *Required format*:
          (setq org-todo-keywords
                '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))

     The ‘|’ separator marks done states (right side) from active states
     (left side).

     *Org-mode keyword options are supported*: You can use org-mode's
     standard keyword syntax with fast access keys and logging options
     (e.g., ‘"TODO(t)"’, ‘"DONE(d!)"’, ‘"WAIT(w@/!)"’).  Org-gtd only
     looks at the base keyword string, so these are equivalent:

          ;; Basic
          '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL"))

          ;; With fast access keys and logging
          '((sequence "TODO(t)" "NEXT(n)" "WAIT(w@/!)" "|" "DONE(d!)" "CNCL(c)"))

   • ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’

     *Type*: Alist mapping GTD states to keyword strings

     *Default*:
          '((todo . "TODO")
            (next . "NEXT")
            (wait . "WAIT")
            (canceled . "CNCL"))

     *Description*: Maps GTD semantic states to your chosen TODO
     keywords.

     *Required keys*:
     ‘todo’
          Tasks not ready to be acted upon
     ‘next’
          Tasks ready to act on immediately
     ‘wait’
          Tasks blocked or delegated to someone else
     ‘done’
          Tasks successfully completed
     ‘canceled’
          Tasks that won't be completed

     *Example*: Using custom keywords:
          (setq org-todo-keywords
                '((sequence "TASK" "DOING" "BLOCKED" "|" "COMPLETE" "CANCELLED")))

          (setq org-gtd-keyword-mapping
                '((todo . "TASK")
                  (next . "DOING")
                  (wait . "BLOCKED")
                  (done . "COMPLETE")
                  (canceled . "CANCELLED")))


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Directory and File Configuration,  Next: Capture Configuration,  Prev: Required Configuration,  Up: Configuration Variables Reference

6.1.2 Directory and File Configuration
--------------------------------------

   • ‘org-gtd-directory’

     *Type*: String (directory path)

     *Default*: ‘"~/gtd/"’

     *Description*: Directory where org-gtd keeps all its files.

     org-gtd creates these files in this directory:
        • ‘inbox.org’ - Capture target (created on first capture)
        • ‘org-gtd-tasks.org’ - Main GTD file containing all organized
          items

     All GTD categories (Actions, Projects, Calendar, Tickler,
     Delegated, etc.)  are stored as top-level headings within
     ‘org-gtd-tasks.org’, not as separate files.  These headings are
     created automatically when you first refile an item to that
     category.

     *Example*:
          (setq org-gtd-directory "~/my-gtd/")

     *Note*: Make sure to add this directory to ‘org-agenda-files’ after
     org-gtd loads:
          (with-eval-after-load 'org-gtd
            (setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory)))

     For ‘use-package’, put this in the ‘:config’ section.

   • ‘org-gtd-additional-inbox-files’

     *Type*: List of file paths

     *Default*: ‘nil’

     *Description*: Additional inbox files to process after the main
     inbox.

     When you call ‘org-gtd-process-inbox’, it first processes all items
     in the main inbox (‘inbox.org’).  After the main inbox is empty, it
     continues processing items from these additional files in order.

     This is useful when you capture items from multiple sources:
        • Mobile apps that sync to a separate file
        • Email-to-org workflows
        • Context-specific inboxes (work, personal)

     *Example*:
          (setq org-gtd-additional-inbox-files
                '("~/gtd/mobile-inbox.org"
                  "~/gtd/email-inbox.org"))

     *Note*: Each file should contain org headings at the top level,
     just like the main inbox.

   • ‘org-gtd-horizons-file’

     *Type*: String (filename)

     *Default*: ‘"horizons.org"’

     *Description*: Name of file (in ‘org-gtd-directory’) containing
     your GTD horizons (long-term goals, areas of focus, purpose).

     This file can be displayed during clarification for context.

     *Example*:
          (setq org-gtd-horizons-file "my-horizons.org")


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Capture Configuration,  Next: Organize and Process Configuration,  Prev: Directory and File Configuration,  Up: Configuration Variables Reference

6.1.3 Capture Configuration
---------------------------

   • ‘org-gtd-capture-templates’

     *Type*: List of org-capture template specifications

     *Default*:
          '(("i" "Inbox"
             entry  (file ,#'org-gtd-inbox-path)
             "* %?\n%U\n\n  %i"
             :kill-buffer t)
            ("l" "Inbox with link"
             entry  (file ,#'org-gtd-inbox-path)
             "* %?\n%U\n\n  %i\n  %a"
             :kill-buffer t))

     *Description*: Capture templates specific to org-gtd inbox.

     *Constraints* (must be satisfied for org-gtd to work correctly):
       1. Template string must start with ‘"* "’ (asterisk + space for
          org heading)
       2. Entry type must be: ‘entry (file ,#'org-gtd-inbox-path)’

     *Example*: Adding a custom template:
          (setq org-gtd-capture-templates
                '(("i" "Inbox"
                   entry (file ,#'org-gtd-inbox-path)
                   "* %?\n%U\n\n  %i"
                   :kill-buffer t)
                  ("m" "Meeting note"
                   entry (file ,#'org-gtd-inbox-path)
                   "* Meeting: %?\n%U\n\nAttendees:\n\nNotes:\n"
                   :kill-buffer t)))


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Organize and Process Configuration,  Next: Mode-Line Configuration,  Prev: Capture Configuration,  Up: Configuration Variables Reference

6.1.4 Organize and Process Configuration
----------------------------------------

   • ‘org-gtd-organize-hooks’

     *Type*: List of functions

     *Default*: ‘'(org-set-tags-command)’

     *Description*: Functions run when organizing each item.  Each
     function can add metadata (tags, properties, etc.)  to the item
     being organized.

     The default value prompts for tags.  Built-in options:
     ‘org-set-tags-command’
          Prompt for tags (default)
     ‘org-gtd-set-area-of-focus’
          Prompt for area of focus
     Custom functions
          Functions you write yourself

     *Example*: Add effort estimation and area of focus:
          (defun my-add-effort ()
            "Prompt for effort when organizing."
            (when (org-gtd-organize-type-member-p '(single-action project-heading))
              (org-set-effort)))

          (setq org-gtd-organize-hooks
                '(org-set-tags-command
                  org-gtd-set-area-of-focus
                  my-add-effort))

     *Helper function*: ‘org-gtd-organize-type-member-p’
        • Takes a list of item types to check against
        • Returns t if current item matches one of the types
        • Available types: ‘single-action’, ‘project-heading’,
          ‘project-task’, ‘calendar’, ‘delegated’, ‘tickler’, ‘someday’,
          ‘habit’, ‘knowledge’, ‘quick-action’, ‘trash’, ‘everything’

   • ‘org-gtd-save-after-organize’

     *Type*: Boolean

     *Default*: ‘nil’

     *Description*: If non-nil, save all modified buffers after each
     organize step.

     Useful if you want automatic saves during inbox processing.

     *Example*:
          (setq org-gtd-save-after-organize t)

   • ‘org-gtd-refile-to-any-target’ (deprecated)

     *Type*: Boolean

     *Default*: ‘t’

     *Deprecated*: As of 4.0.0.  Use ‘org-gtd-refile-prompt-for-types’
     instead.

     *Description*: Control refile behavior when organizing items.  This
     variable is deprecated and will show a warning when used.

        • When ‘t’: org-gtd will refile to the first target it finds
          without prompting (deprecated behavior)
        • When ‘nil’: org-gtd consults ‘org-gtd-refile-prompt-for-types’
          to decide per item type

     *Migration*: To migrate to the new system:

          ;; Step 1: Set the deprecated variable to nil (required)
          ;; This enables per-type control via org-gtd-refile-prompt-for-types
          (setq org-gtd-refile-to-any-target nil)

          ;; Step 2 (optional): Customize which types prompt
          ;; The default prompts for most types except quick-action, knowledge, trash
          ;; Only change this if you want different behavior:
          ;; (setq org-gtd-refile-prompt-for-types '(project-heading project-task))

     See *note Controlling Refile Prompts by Item Type:: for the new
     approach.

   • ‘org-gtd-refile-prompt-for-types’

     *Type*: List of symbols

     *Default*: ‘(single-action project-heading project-task calendar
     someday delegated tickler habit)’

     *Description*: List of GTD item types that should prompt for refile
     target selection when organizing.

        • Types in the list prompt user to choose from available refile
          targets
        • Types *not* in the list auto-refile to the first available
          target
        • Only consulted when ‘org-gtd-refile-to-any-target’ is ‘nil’

     *Valid type symbols:* ‘single-action’, ‘project-heading’,
     ‘project-task’, ‘calendar’, ‘someday’, ‘delegated’, ‘tickler’,
     ‘habit’, ‘knowledge’, ‘quick-action’, ‘trash’

     *Example*: Only prompt for projects, auto-refile everything else:

          (setq org-gtd-refile-prompt-for-types '(project-heading project-task))

     *Example*: Add knowledge items to prompt list (they auto-refile by
     default):

          (setq org-gtd-refile-prompt-for-types
                '(single-action project-heading project-task calendar
                  someday delegated tickler habit knowledge))

6.1.5 Mode-Line Configuration
-----------------------------

   • ‘org-gtd-mode-update-interval’

     *Type*: Integer (seconds) or nil

     *Default*: ‘60’

     *Description*: Seconds between automatic inbox count refreshes when
     ‘org-gtd-mode’ is enabled.

     The mode-line lighter (e.g., ‘GTD[5]’) updates automatically when
     Emacs redraws the mode-line.  This setting controls an additional
     periodic refresh to catch external file changes (like mobile app
     syncs).

     Values:
     Integer
          Refresh every N seconds
     ‘nil’
          Disable periodic refresh (count still updates on mode-line
          redraw)

     *Example*: Refresh every 30 seconds:
          (setq org-gtd-mode-update-interval 30)

     *Example*: Disable periodic refresh:
          (setq org-gtd-mode-update-interval nil)

   • ‘org-gtd-mode-lighter-display’

     *Type*: Symbol

     *Default*: ‘'always’

     *Description*: Controls when the GTD lighter appears in the
     mode-line.

     Values:
     ‘'always’
          Always show the lighter (e.g., ‘GTD[0]’, ‘GTD[5]’)
     ‘'never’
          Never show the lighter
     ‘'when-non-zero’
          Only show when inbox has items

     *Example*: Hide lighter when inbox is empty:
          (setq org-gtd-mode-lighter-display 'when-non-zero)

     *Note*: If both this and ‘org-gtd-clarify-show-horizons’ are set to
     the same side, Emacs will stack the windows vertically in that side
     area.

   • ‘org-gtd-clarify-display-helper-buffer’

     *Type*: Boolean

     *Default*: ‘nil’

     *Description*: If non-nil, display project dependencies helper
     window when clarifying projects.

     When enabled, shows a live view of task relationships in a side
     window when there are multiple tasks in the WIP buffer.

     Useful for:
        • Understanding complex dependency graphs
        • Spotting cycles before they cause problems
        • Planning parallel execution paths

     *Example*:
          (setq org-gtd-clarify-display-helper-buffer t)

   • ‘org-gtd-clarify-project-templates’

     *Type*: Alist of (name .  template) strings

     *Default*: ‘nil’

     *Description*: Pre-defined project templates for common project
     types.

     Each entry is a pair of (template-name .  template-tasks) where
     template-tasks is a string of org headings to insert.

     *Example*:
          (setq org-gtd-clarify-project-templates
                '(("Blog Post" . "** Research topic\n** Write draft\n** Edit\n** Add images\n** Publish")
                  ("Code Feature" . "** Design API\n** Write tests\n** Implement feature\n** Code review\n** Merge")))

     *Entering newlines in templates*: When setting this variable in
     your configuration file, use ‘\n’ for newlines as shown above.  If
     entering template strings interactively (e.g., via ‘M-x
     customize-variable’ or in the minibuffer), use ‘C-q C-j’ to insert
     a literal newline character.  This works on all platforms including
     Windows.

     Use ‘org-gtd-clarify-project-insert-template’ during clarification
     to insert a template.

   • ‘org-gtd-clarify-duplicate-queue-position’

     *Type*: Symbol

     *Default*: ‘'bottom’

     *Description*: Position for the duplicate queue window during
     clarification.

     When you create duplicates during clarification, a side window
     appears showing pending duplicates.  This variable controls where
     that window appears.

     Values:
     ‘'top’
          Show queue window at top
     ‘'bottom’
          Show queue window at bottom
     ‘'left’
          Show queue window on left
     ‘'right’
          Show queue window on right

     *Example*:
          (setq org-gtd-clarify-duplicate-queue-position 'right)

6.1.7 Areas of Focus Configuration
----------------------------------

   • ‘org-gtd-areas-of-focus’

     *Type*: List of strings

     *Default*: ‘'("Home" "Health" "Family" "Career")’

     *Description*: Your areas of focus (GTD Horizon 2) - the major
     areas in your life where you don't want to drop balls.

     Used when:
        • Adding area of focus to items (via ‘org-gtd-set-area-of-focus’
          hook)
        • Reviewing specific areas with ‘org-gtd-reflect-area-of-focus’

     *Example*:
          (setq org-gtd-areas-of-focus
                '("Work" "Home" "Health" "Learning" "Relationships" "Finance"))

6.1.8 View Prefix Configuration
-------------------------------

   • ‘org-gtd-prefix-width’

     *Type*: Integer

     *Default*: ‘12’

     *Description*: Default width for the prefix column in org-gtd
     views.

     The prefix shows context information (project name, area of focus,
     etc.)  on the left side of each task.  This variable sets the
     default width used when no explicit ‘prefix-width’ is specified in
     a view spec.

     Long values are truncated with "…".  Short values are padded with
     spaces.

     *Example*: Increase space for longer project names:
          (setq org-gtd-prefix-width 20)

     *Note*: You can also set ‘prefix-width’ per-view in the View DSL.
     See *note Prefix DSL: Prefix DSL Customizing the Task Prefix
     Column.

     *Backward compatibility*: The old name
     ‘org-gtd-engage-prefix-width’ still works but is deprecated.

6.1.9 Archive Configuration
---------------------------

   • ‘org-gtd-archive-location’

     *Type*: Function (zero arguments, returns string) or ‘nil’

     *Default*: ‘#'org-gtd-archive-location-func’

     *Description*: Archive location for org-gtd, or ‘nil’ to use
     ‘org-archive-location’.

     When ‘nil’, org-gtd uses org-mode's standard ‘org-archive-location’
     variable.  This allows you to use your existing org-mode archive
     configuration with org-gtd.

     When a function, calls it to get the archive location string.  The
     returned string must match ‘org-archive-location’ format.

     Default function generates: ‘gtd_archive_YYYY.org::datetree/’
     (year-based archive files in ‘org-gtd-directory’).

     *Example*: Use org-mode's standard archive location:
          ;; Respect your org-archive-location setting
          (setq org-gtd-archive-location nil)
          ;; Configure org-mode's archive as usual
          (setq org-archive-location "archive.org::* Archived")

     *Example*: Archive to a single file:
          (defun my-archive-location ()
            "Archive to a single file."
            "archive.org::")

          (setq org-gtd-archive-location #'my-archive-location)

     *Example*: Archive to month-based files:
          (defun my-monthly-archive ()
            "Archive to month-based files."
            (format "archive-%s.org::datetree/"
                    (format-time-string "%Y-%m")))

          (setq org-gtd-archive-location #'my-monthly-archive)

6.1.10 Missed Engagements Review Configuration
----------------------------------------------

   • ‘org-gtd-reflect-missed-custom-views’

     *Type*: List of GTD view specifications

     *Default*: ‘nil’

     *Purpose*: Create custom views to find specific types of missed
     engagements (e.g., only work-related items, only specific areas of
     focus).

     Think of this like creating saved searches.  Instead of seeing ALL
     missed items, you can create views that show only the ones relevant
     to a specific context.

     *When to use*: If you have multiple areas of focus (Work, Home,
     Hobbies) and want to review each separately.

     *Example - Area-Specific Reviews*:
          (setq org-gtd-reflect-missed-custom-views
                '(((name . "Overdue Work Items")
                   (area-of-focus . "Work")
                   (deadline . past))
                  ((name . "Missed Home Appointments")
                   (area-of-focus . "Home")
                   (type . calendar)
                   (when . past))))

     After configuring, run ‘M-x org-gtd-reflect-missed-with-custom’ to
     see all standard views plus your custom ones.

     *Backward compatibility*: The old variable name
     ‘org-gtd-oops-custom-views’ still works but will be removed in a
     future version.

6.1.11 Advanced Item Configuration
----------------------------------

   • ‘org-gtd-user-types’

     *Type*: Alist

     *Default*: ‘'()’

     *Description*: Customize property prompts and input methods for
     built-in GTD types.

     This alist allows you to override how org-gtd prompts for
     properties when organizing items.  You can customize existing types
     but cannot add new ones.

     Each entry is ‘(TYPE-NAME . PLIST)’ where TYPE-NAME must be one of:
     ‘next-action’, ‘delegated’, ‘calendar’, ‘tickler’, ‘someday’,
     ‘project’, ‘habit’, ‘reference’, ‘trash’, ‘quick-action’.

     *Property attributes you can set:*

     Attribute         Description
     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     ‘:prompt’         The prompt string shown to the user
     ‘:input-fn’       Custom function for input (overrides default prompt)
     ‘:default’        Default value (skips prompting if set)
     ‘:type’           Input type: ‘text’, ‘timestamp’, ‘repeating-timestamp’
     ‘:required’       Whether the property is required (‘t’ or ‘nil’)
     ‘:org-property’   The org-mode property name (string)

     *Example: Integrating Contact Managers with Delegation*

     BBDB and EBDB are Emacs contact management packages.  You can
     configure org-gtd to use completion from your contacts database
     when delegating tasks.

     For EBDB integration:
          ;; Define function to complete from EBDB contacts
          (defun my/ebdb-completing-read (prompt)
            "Read a contact name from EBDB with completion."
            (completing-read prompt
                             (mapcar (lambda (rec) (ebdb-record-name-string rec))
                                     (ebdb-records))
                             nil t))

          ;; Configure delegation to use EBDB completion
          (setq org-gtd-user-types
                '((delegated
                   :properties
                   ((:who :org-property "DELEGATED_TO" :type text :required t
                          :prompt "Delegate to"
                          :input-fn my/ebdb-completing-read)))))

     For BBDB integration, use ‘bbdb-records’ and ‘bbdb-record-name’
     instead:
          (defun my/bbdb-completing-read (prompt)
            "Read a contact name from BBDB with completion."
            (completing-read prompt
                             (mapcar #'bbdb-record-name (bbdb-records))
                             nil t))

     This pattern works for any completion source (org-contacts, custom
     databases, etc.).

     *Example: Custom prompt text*

     Change the default prompts without changing input behavior:
          (setq org-gtd-user-types
                '((delegated
                   :properties
                   ((:who :org-property "DELEGATED_TO" :type text :required t
                          :prompt "Assign to team member")
                    (:when :org-property "ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP" :type timestamp :required t
                           :prompt "Follow-up date")))))

6.1.12 Agenda Display Configuration
-----------------------------------

These variables control how properties are displayed in org-agenda
views.  When you run ‘org-gtd-engage’ or other agenda commands, these
settings determine what additional information appears alongside each
task.

   • ‘org-gtd-agenda-property-list’

     *Type*: List of strings

     *Default*: ‘'("LOCATION")’

     *Description*: Properties to display in agenda views.

     When a task has any of these properties set, the value appears in
     the agenda line.  Useful for showing context like location,
     delegated person, or custom metadata.

     *Example*:
          ;; Show location and who tasks are delegated to
          (setq org-gtd-agenda-property-list '("LOCATION" "DELEGATED_TO"))

   • ‘org-gtd-agenda-property-position’

     *Type*: Symbol

     *Default*: ‘'where-it-fits’

     *Description*: Where properties appear relative to the agenda line.

     Values:
     ‘'same-line’
          On the same line, starting at ‘org-gtd-agenda-property-column’
     ‘'next-line’
          On the line below the task
     ‘'where-it-fits’
          Same line if it fits in the window, otherwise next line
          (default)

     *Example*:
          (setq org-gtd-agenda-property-position 'next-line)

   • ‘org-gtd-agenda-property-column’

     *Type*: Integer

     *Default*: ‘60’

     *Description*: Column position where properties start when using
     ‘'same-line’ or ‘'where-it-fits’ position.

     Increase this if your task descriptions are long; decrease if you
     want properties closer to the task text.

     *Example*:
          (setq org-gtd-agenda-property-column 50)

   • ‘org-gtd-agenda-property-separator’

     *Type*: String

     *Default*: ‘"|"’

     *Description*: Separator between multiple property values when a
     task has more than one property from
     ‘org-gtd-agenda-property-list’.

     *Example*:
          (setq org-gtd-agenda-property-separator " · ")

6.1.13 Graph View Configuration
-------------------------------

These variables control the project graph visualization feature.

   • ‘org-gtd-graph-render-mode’

     *Type*: Symbol

     *Default*: ‘'svg’

     *Description*: Default rendering mode for project dependency
     graphs.

     Values:
     ‘'svg’
          High-quality graphical rendering (requires GUI Emacs)
     ‘'ascii’
          Text-based rendering using box-drawing characters (works in
          terminal)

     You can toggle between modes in any graph buffer by pressing ‘v’.

     *Example*:
          ;; Use ASCII mode by default (good for terminal users)
          (setq org-gtd-graph-render-mode 'ascii)

     *See also*: *note Graph Rendering Modes:: for detailed comparison.

   • ‘org-gtd-graph-ui-split-ratio’

     *Type*: Float (0.0 to 1.0)

     *Default*: ‘0.7’

     *Description*: Width ratio for the graph window when showing
     project graphs.

     The graph view displays two panels: the dependency graph and a
     details panel showing the selected task.  This ratio controls how
     much horizontal space the graph takes.

        • ‘0.7’ means the graph takes 70% of width, details take 30%
          (default)
        • ‘0.5’ would give equal space to both
        • ‘0.8’ would give more space to the graph

     *Example*:
          ;; Give more space to the details panel
          (setq org-gtd-graph-ui-split-ratio 0.6)

   • ‘org-gtd-graph-sibling-mode’

     *Type*: Symbol

     *Default*: ‘'any-same-blocker’

     *Description*: How to determine sibling tasks for TAB/S-TAB
     navigation in graph view.

     When you press TAB or S-TAB in graph view, you move between
     "sibling" tasks.  This variable controls what counts as a sibling:

     Values:
     ‘'any-same-blocker’
          Tasks sharing at least one blocker (default).  Two tasks are
          siblings if they have any blocker in common.  This groups
          tasks that are conceptually related through shared
          prerequisites.
     ‘'all-same-blockers’
          Tasks with exactly the same set of blockers.  Two tasks are
          siblings only if their blocker sets are identical.  This is
          stricter and shows only tasks that are truly parallel
          alternatives.
     ‘'dag-level’
          Tasks at the same depth in the dependency graph.  Two tasks
          are siblings if they have the same layer number, regardless of
          their actual blockers.  This gives a visual/structural
          grouping.

     *Example*:
          ;; Default: share any blocker
          (setq org-gtd-graph-sibling-mode 'any-same-blocker)

          ;; Strict: exact same blockers only
          (setq org-gtd-graph-sibling-mode 'all-same-blockers)

          ;; Structural: same depth in graph
          (setq org-gtd-graph-sibling-mode 'dag-level)

     *When to use each mode*:

        • *any-same-blocker (default)*: Best for most users.  When
          you're on "Write tests" and press TAB, you'll see other tasks
          that also depend on "Set up project"—tasks you could work on
          in parallel after finishing the blocker.

        • *all-same-blockers*: Use when you want strict parallelism.
          Only shows tasks that are truly equivalent alternatives—same
          prerequisites, same position in the workflow.

        • *dag-level*: Use when you think visually about your project.
          Groups all tasks at the same "layer" or depth, regardless of
          their actual dependencies.

     *See also*: *note Graph View Command Reference:: for navigation
     keybindings.

6.1.14 Projects Configuration
-----------------------------

   • ‘org-gtd-project-progress-cookie-position’

     *Type*: Symbol or nil

     *Default*: ‘'end’

     *Description*: Controls where progress cookies are displayed on
     project headings.

     Values:
     ‘nil’
          Disabled (no cookies shown)
     ‘'start’
          After TODO keyword, before title
     ‘'end’
          After heading text, before tags (default)

     Progress cookies show project completion as
     ‘[completed/total][percent%]’ format, for example ‘[3/7][42%]’.

     Unlike org-mode's built-in statistics cookies (‘[/]’ or ‘[%]’)
     which count direct children, org-gtd's progress cookies correctly
     count all tasks linked to the project via ‘ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS’,
     making them accurate for the DAG-based project structure.

     *Example*:
          ;; Show cookies at end of heading (default)
          (setq org-gtd-project-progress-cookie-position 'end)

          ;; Show cookies at start of heading
          (setq org-gtd-project-progress-cookie-position 'start)

          ;; Disable progress cookies
          (setq org-gtd-project-progress-cookie-position nil)

     *What it looks like*:
          ;; With 'end (default):
          * PROJ Buy a house [3/7][42%]                    :home:

          ;; With 'start:
          * PROJ [3/7][42%] Buy a house                    :home:

          ;; With nil:
          * PROJ Buy a house                               :home:

     *Automatic updates*: Cookies are automatically recalculated when:
        • Task TODO states change (via hook)
        • Project is created
        • ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-all-todo-keywords’ is run
        • ‘org-gtd-project-update-all-cookies’ is called manually

     *See also*: *note Project Progress Cookies: Project Progress
     Cookies See Your Progress at a Glance. for detailed usage, *note
     org-gtd-project-update-all-cookies:: for manual refresh.

6.2.4 Reviewing Someday/Maybe Items
-----------------------------------

Someday/maybe items are the graveyard of dreams—or the incubator of
future greatness.  The difference?  Regular review.  This feature helps
you stay connected to your possibilities without letting them become
forgotten fossils.

   *What is it*: A wizard-style workflow that shows you each someday
item one at a time, letting you quickly defer it (keep for later) or
clarify it (reactivate and make it actionable).

   *Who needs it*: Anyone with someday/maybe items who wants to
periodically review them during their GTD reflect process.

   • Your First Review in 60 Seconds

     Try this right now:

       1. Run ‘M-x org-gtd-reflect-someday-review’
       2. You'll see your first someday item in a read-only buffer
       3. Press ‘d’ to defer (keeps the item, logs that you reviewed it)
       4. Or press ‘c’ to clarify (reactivates the item)
       5. Press ‘q’ anytime to quit

     That's it.  You're reviewing your possibilities.

   • Understanding the Review Workflow

     When you see a someday item during review, you're asking yourself
     one question: "Is now the time to pursue this?"

          Someday item: "Learn to play piano"

          Is now the time?
            YES → Press 'c' (clarify) → Item becomes active, you organize it fresh
            NO  → Press 'd' (defer) → Item stays in someday, with timestamp logged

     *Why defer logs a timestamp*: The LOGBOOK entry creates a history.
     During future reviews, you can see how long items have been
     sitting.  An item deferred 50 times over 3 years might be ready to
     trash—or finally pursue.

   • Tutorial: Weekly Someday Review

     Here's how to incorporate this into your weekly review:

     *Basic flow*:
          M-x org-gtd-reflect-someday-review

          For each item:
          - Read it
          - Decide: defer or clarify?
          - Press d or c
          - Repeat until "Review complete"

     *What happens when you clarify*:
       1. The item's previous state is restored (if it was a delegated
          action, it remembers the delegate)
       2. You go through the organize flow
       3. After organizing, review automatically continues with the next
          item

     *What happens when you defer*:
       1. A "Reviewed [timestamp]" entry is added to the item's LOGBOOK
       2. Review advances to the next item
       3. The item stays in someday/maybe

   • Organizing Your Someday Items (Optional)

     If your someday list grows large, you can group items into named
     lists:

          ;; Optional: Define someday lists for focused reviews
          (setq org-gtd-someday-lists '("Work Ideas" "Personal Projects" "Learning" "Travel"))

     With this configured:

       1. *When organizing items as someday*: You'll be prompted to
          choose a list
       2. *When reviewing*: You'll be prompted which list to review (or
          "Unassigned")
       3. *Programmatic access*: Call ‘(org-gtd-reflect-someday-review
          "Work Ideas")’ directly

     This is entirely optional.  Without configuration, all someday
     items are reviewed together.

   • Common Patterns

     *Monthly Deep Review*:
          ;; Review everything, no list filter
          M-x org-gtd-reflect-someday-review

          ;; Go through each item thoughtfully
          ;; This might take 15-30 minutes for 50 items

     *Focused Category Review*:
          ;; With org-gtd-someday-lists configured:
          M-x org-gtd-reflect-someday-review → "Learning"

          ;; Only see learning-related someday items

     *Finding Stale Items*: Look at items during review that have many
     LOGBOOK entries spanning years.  Ask yourself: "Am I ever actually
     going to do this?"  If not, trash it.  If yes, this might be the
     time to clarify it.

   • Command Reference

     Key   Command   What it does

     ‘c’   Clarify   Reactivate item, triggers organize flow
     ‘q’   Quit      End review, show statistics

     *Statistics*: When you quit or finish, you'll see: "Review
     complete.  X items reviewed, Y clarified."

   • ‘org-gtd-reflect-someday-review’

     *Arguments*: Optional LIST (string)

     *When to use*: During weekly/monthly reviews, or anytime you want
     to reconnect with your possibilities

     *What it does*:
        • If ‘org-gtd-someday-lists’ is configured: prompts for which
          list to review
        • Shows each someday item in a read-only buffer
        • Single-keystroke actions: ‘d’ (defer), ‘c’ (clarify), ‘q’
          (quit)
        • Tracks statistics (items reviewed, items clarified)

     *Configuration*:
          ;; Optional: Group someday items into lists
          (setq org-gtd-someday-lists '("Work Ideas" "Personal" "Learning"))

     *Example*:
          ;; Interactive (will prompt for list if configured)
          M-x org-gtd-reflect-someday-review

          ;; Programmatic (skip list prompt)
          (org-gtd-reflect-someday-review "Work Ideas")

6.2.5 Reflect Commands (Missed Engagements)
-------------------------------------------

   • What Are Missed Engagements?

     Life doesn't go as planned.  You miss appointments, delegated items
     slip through cracks, projects run late.  These aren't
     failures—they're normal.  What matters is catching them and
     deciding what to do next.

     The missed engagements review helps you find three types of items
     that need attention:
        • *Appointments you missed*: Calendar items with dates in the
          past
        • *Check-ins you forgot*: Delegated items where follow-up dates
          passed
        • *Projects running late*: Projects with overdue deadlines or
          start dates

     This is your safety net.  Run it daily or weekly to ensure nothing
     falls through the cracks.

   • Your First Review in 30 Seconds

     Try this right now:

       1. Run ‘M-x org-gtd-reflect-missed-engagements’
       2. Look at what appears in the agenda view
       3. Press ‘TAB’ on any item to see its details

     That's it.  You're now reviewing missed engagements.

     If you see items, ask yourself: "What should I do about this now?"
     Then organize accordingly (reschedule, cancel, or act).

   • Understanding the Review Workflow

     Think of GTD like a promise system.  When you:
        • Schedule an appointment → you promise to be there at that time
        • Delegate a task → you promise to check in on the date you set
        • Set a project deadline → you promise to complete by that date

     When dates pass without action, you've broken a promise (to
     yourself or others).

     The review workflow helps you:
       1. *Find* broken promises (missed engagements)
       2. *Decide* what to do about them
       3. *Act* on your decision

     This isn't about guilt—it's about staying in control.

   • Tutorial: Daily Review Workflow

     Here's how to use this in your daily routine:

     *Morning Review* (2 minutes):
          M-x org-gtd-reflect-missed-engagements

          Look at each item:
          - Missed appointment? Reschedule or apologize
          - Forgot to check in on delegation? Do it now
          - Project running late? Decide: extend deadline or cancel

     *Focusing on One Type*:

     If you just want to see missed appointments:
          M-x org-gtd-reflect-missed-calendar

     Or just delegated items needing check-ins:
          M-x org-gtd-reflect-missed-delegated

     Or just late projects:
          M-x org-gtd-reflect-missed-projects

     Each command shows only that type, making it easier to focus.

   • Common Patterns

     *Pattern 1: Morning Triage* Start each day by reviewing missed
     engagements.  Handle or reschedule everything before starting new
     work.

     *Pattern 2: Weekly Cleanup* During weekly review, run the full
     missed engagements view.  This catches anything that slipped
     through daily reviews.

     *Pattern 3: Context-Specific Review* Use custom views to see missed
     items by area of focus (see configuration below).

   • Command Reference

     Command                                Shows                          Use When
     -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     ‘org-gtd-reflect-missed-engagements’   All missed items               Daily/weekly review
     ‘org-gtd-reflect-missed-calendar’      Missed appointments only       Checking calendar
     ‘org-gtd-reflect-missed-delegated’     Delegations needing check-in   Following up on delegated work
     ‘org-gtd-reflect-missed-projects’      Late projects only             Project review
     ‘org-gtd-reflect-missed-with-custom’   All missed + custom views      Using custom filters

   • Backward Compatibility Note

     The old command names still work:
        • ‘org-gtd-oops’ → ‘org-gtd-reflect-missed-engagements’
        • ‘org-gtd-oops-calendar’ → ‘org-gtd-reflect-missed-calendar’
        • ‘org-gtd-oops-delegated’ → ‘org-gtd-reflect-missed-delegated’
        • ‘org-gtd-oops-projects’ → ‘org-gtd-reflect-missed-projects’
        • ‘org-gtd-oops-with-custom’ →
          ‘org-gtd-reflect-missed-with-custom’

     Update to the new names when convenient.  The old names will be
     removed in a future version.

6.2.6 Reflect Commands (Upcoming Delegated)
-------------------------------------------

   • What Are Upcoming Delegated Check-ins?

     You delegate work and set check-in dates.  Some people finish
     early.  Others appreciate regular check-ins.  Waiting until
     check-in dates pass means lost opportunities.

     The upcoming delegated review shows all active delegated items with
     future check-in dates.  This helps you:
        • *Catch early completions*: Someone finished early, you can
          adjust the plan now
        • *Plan your follow-ups*: See what check-ins are coming this
          week or month
        • *Proactive management*: Reach out before problems develop

     This is your planning tool.  Use it weekly to prepare your
     delegation check-ins, or ad-hoc when people report early progress.

   • Your First Review in 30 Seconds

     Try this right now:

       1. Run ‘M-x org-gtd-reflect-upcoming-delegated’
       2. Look at the delegated items with future check-in dates
       3. Press ‘TAB’ on any item to see when the check-in is scheduled

     That's it.  You're now seeing upcoming delegation check-ins.

     If someone tells you they finished early, you'll find that item
     here and can update your plans accordingly.

   • Understanding Proactive Delegation Management

     Think about delegation timing:

     *Reactive management* (missed engagements):
        • Check-in date passes → you remember to follow up
        • Problem discovered after it's late
        • Always catching up

     *Proactive management* (upcoming review):
        • See check-ins coming this week → prepare questions
        • Someone finishes early → immediately unblock dependent work
        • Stay ahead of problems

     The upcoming delegated review shifts you from reactive to
     proactive.

   • Tutorial: Weekly Planning Workflow

     Here's how to use this in your weekly planning:

     *Sunday Planning* (5 minutes):
          M-x org-gtd-reflect-upcoming-delegated

          For each item:
          - Check-in this week? Prepare questions or schedule call
          - Might finish early? Be ready to adjust plans
          - Blocked on something? Follow up proactively

     *When Someone Reports Early Completion*:
          M-x org-gtd-reflect-upcoming-delegated

          Find their item in the list
          Press TAB to jump to the item
          Mark it DONE (it disappears from the upcoming view)
          Check if this unblocks other work in the project

     *Combined with Missed Review*:
          # Morning routine
          M-x org-gtd-reflect-missed-delegated    # Catch up on late check-ins
          M-x org-gtd-reflect-upcoming-delegated  # Plan upcoming check-ins

     The first shows what you missed.  The second shows what's coming.
     Together they give complete delegation visibility.

   • Common Patterns

     *Pattern 1: Weekly Planning* Every Sunday or Monday, review
     upcoming delegated items for the week.  Know what check-ins are
     coming so you're prepared.

     *Pattern 2: Early Completion Response* When someone says "I
     finished that task you gave me," pull up this view to find it
     quickly and update your plans.

     *Pattern 3: Project Acceleration* Review a specific project's
     delegated items.  If anyone finished early, immediately reassign
     work to take advantage of the extra time.

     *Pattern 4: Delegation Optimization* Notice patterns: Who
     consistently finishes early?  Give them more work.  Who's always
     late?  More frequent check-ins.

   • Understanding What You See

     The view shows all active (not done) delegated items with future
     check-in dates:
        • Items with TODO, NEXT, or WAIT states
        • Items with check-ins far in the future (months away)
        • Items from all areas of focus

     Once you mark an item DONE or CNCL, it disappears from this view
     automatically—you've already processed it and taken action.

     If you see too many items and want to filter:
        • Focus on one project at a time (use project-specific review)
        • Look at specific timeframes (future enhancement—not yet
          implemented)
        • Use custom views with area-of-focus filters

   • Comparison: Missed vs Upcoming

     Review Type          Shows              Mindset                  Use When
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Missed Delegated     Past check-ins     Reactive - catching up   Daily triage
     Upcoming Delegated   Future check-ins   Proactive - planning     Weekly planning

     Both are valuable.  Missed helps you catch problems.  Upcoming
     helps you prevent them.

6.2.7 Custom View Commands
--------------------------

   • ‘org-gtd-view-show’

     **What it is:** Create custom GTD agenda views using a declarative
     language instead of learning org-agenda skip function internals.

     **Why you'd use it:** The built-in views (engage,
     review-stuck-projects, etc.)  cover common needs, but you have
     unique workflows.  Maybe you only want to see work-related NEXT
     actions, or projects in a specific area, or items tagged "urgent".
     This lets you create exactly the view you need.

     **Who needs it:** Users who want views tailored to their specific
     workflow beyond the built-in commands.

     **Your first custom view (5 minutes):**

     Let's create a view showing only your NEXT actions (no calendar, no
     agenda).

       1. Add this to your config file:
               (defun my-next-actions ()
                 "Show all NEXT actions in a simple list."
                 (interactive)
                 (org-gtd-view-show
                  '((name . "All NEXT Actions")
                    (type . next-action))))

       2. Save and reload your config (‘M-x eval-buffer’ or restart
          Emacs)

       3. Run it:
               M-x my-next-actions

     You'll see all your NEXT actions in one list.  That's it—you've
     created a custom view!

     **Understanding how views work:**

     Think of views like filtered searches.  You tell org-gtd what to
     show, and it finds matching items.

     The built-in ‘org-gtd-engage’ command?  It uses ‘org-gtd-view-show’
     internally.  ‘org-gtd-reflect-stuck-projects’?  Same thing.  You're
     now using the same tool the package uses to create its own views.

     View specs are simple: give it a ‘name’ and add filters.  Filters
     are pairs like ‘(filter-type . value)’.  Multiple filters combine
     with AND logic—all must match.

          ;; Simple view spec
          '((name . "Delegated Items")
            (type . delegated))

     The most common filter is ‘type’, which matches GTD item types:
     ‘project’, ‘next-action’, ‘calendar’, ‘delegated’, ‘tickler’,
     ‘someday’, ‘habit’, ‘stuck-project’, ‘completed-project’.

     **Tutorial: Common custom views**

     *Show only work-related NEXT actions:*

          (defun my-work-next-actions ()
            "Show NEXT actions for work projects only."
            (interactive)
            (org-gtd-view-show
             '((name . "Work NEXT Actions")
               (type . next-action)
               (area-of-focus . "Work"))))

     Two filters: must be a next-action AND must be in Work area.

     *Show projects that are stuck:*

          (defun my-stuck-projects ()
            "Show projects with no NEXT actions."
            (interactive)
            (org-gtd-view-show
             '((name . "Stuck Projects")
               (type . stuck-project))))

     One filter: type must be stuck-project (built-in type that checks
     for stuck state).

     *Show delegated items due today:*

          (defun my-delegated-today ()
            "Show delegated items with check-ins due today."
            (interactive)
            (org-gtd-view-show
             '((name . "Delegated Check-ins Today")
               (type . delegated)
               (when . today))))

     The ‘when’ filter uses semantic time: ‘today’, ‘past’, or ‘future’.
     It automatically knows that for delegated items, "when" means the
     ‘ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP’ property.

     *Show multiple related views together:*

          (defun my-morning-review ()
            "Show morning planning views: NEXT actions and calendar."
            (interactive)
            (org-gtd-view-show
             '(((name . "Today's NEXT Actions")
                (type . next-action))
               ((name . "Delegated Items to Follow Up")
                (type . delegated)
                (when . today)))))

     This shows TWO views in one agenda: NEXT actions first, then
     delegated items due today.

     **Common patterns:**

     *Filter by type (most common):*
          (type . project)          ; All projects
          (type . next-action)      ; Single actions (with NEXT keyword)
          (type . delegated)        ; Delegated items (with WAIT keyword)
          (type . calendar)         ; Calendar items
          (type . tickler)          ; Tickler items (time-based reminders)
          (type . someday)          ; Someday/maybe items
          (type . habit)            ; Habits
          (type . stuck-project)    ; Projects needing attention
          (type . completed-project) ; Projects ready to archive

     *Filter by semantic time (‘when’):*
          (when . today)            ; Items due today
          (when . past)             ; Missed items
          (when . future)           ; Upcoming items

     The ‘when’ filter automatically uses the right timestamp property
     for each type:
        • For ‘delegated’ and ‘calendar’: checks ‘ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP’
        • For ‘tickler’: checks the tickler review date

     *Filter by area of focus:*
          (area-of-focus . "Work")

     *Combine multiple filters (AND logic):*
          '((name . "Overdue Work Projects")
            (type . project)
            (area-of-focus . "Work")
            (deadline . past))
          ;; Shows: Projects AND Work area AND overdue

     **When to create custom views:**

     Create a custom view when you find yourself:
        • Repeatedly filtering the engage view manually
        • Wanting to see specific combinations org-gtd doesn't provide
        • Needing views for specific contexts (home office, traveling,
          morning routine)
        • Organizing weekly reviews around specific categories

     Don't create views for one-time queries—just use the built-in views
     and navigate.  Create views for repeated patterns in your workflow.

     **Binding to keys:**

     Once you've created a view you use often, bind it to a key:

          ;; Vanilla Emacs
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d w") 'my-work-next-actions)

          ;; Doom Emacs (in config.el)
          (map! :leader
                (:prefix "d"
                 :desc "Work NEXT actions" "w" #'my-work-next-actions))

          ;; Spacemacs (in user-config)
          (spacemacs/set-leader-keys "od w" 'my-work-next-actions)

     **Complete filter reference:**

     For the full list of available filters and their syntax, see *note
     View DSL Reference: View DSL Filter Reference.

     Common filters include:
     ‘type’
          project, next-action, delegated, calendar, tickler, someday,
          habit, stuck-project, completed-project, stuck-delegated,
          stuck-calendar, stuck-tickler, stuck-habit
     ‘when’
          Semantic time filter (today, past, future) - automatically
          uses correct property per type
     ‘area-of-focus’
          Specific area/category
     ‘deadline’, ‘scheduled’
          Org timestamp filters (past, future, today)
     ‘tags’
          Match specific tags

     **Command reference:**

     *Function signature:*
          (org-gtd-view-show VIEW-SPEC-OR-SPECS &optional KEYS)

     *Arguments:*
     ‘VIEW-SPEC-OR-SPECS’
          Either a single view specification (alist) or list of view
          specifications
     ‘KEYS’
          Optional string used as the agenda dispatch key (defaults to
          "g").  When ‘org-agenda-sticky’ is non-nil, different KEYS
          values allow multiple independent agenda views to be displayed
          simultaneously

     *View specification structure:*
          ;; Simple view - filters are top-level
          '((name . "View Name")
            (type . delegated)
            (when . past))

     *Multiple views:*
          '(((name . "View 1")
             (type . next-action))
            ((name . "View 2")
             (type . stuck-project)))

     *Returns:* Opens org-agenda buffer with the specified view

     *Example:*
          ;; Single view
          (org-gtd-view-show
           '((name . "Active Projects")
             (type . project)))

          ;; Multiple views
          (org-gtd-view-show
           '(((name . "NEXT Actions")
              (type . next-action))
             ((name . "Stuck Projects")
              (type . stuck-project))))

     **Using Multiple Concurrent Views:**

     By default, calling ‘org-gtd-view-show’ multiple times replaces the
     previous agenda buffer.  To display multiple views simultaneously:

       1. Enable sticky agenda buffers:
               (setq org-agenda-sticky t)

       2. Pass different KEYS to each call:
               (defun my-dashboard ()
                 "Show my GTD dashboard with multiple views."
                 (interactive)
                 (delete-other-windows)
                 (org-gtd-view-show '((name . "Next Actions") (type . next-action)) "a")
                 (split-window-right)
                 (other-window 1)
                 (org-gtd-view-show '((name . "Calendar") (type . calendar)) "c"))

     Each view will appear in its own buffer: ‘*Org Agenda(a)*’, ‘*Org
     Agenda(c)*’, etc.

        • Creates a duplicate with that title
        • Adds duplicate to a queue
        • Shows queue window if not already visible
        • After organizing current item, the duplicate opens for
          clarification

     *Example*: You captured "Prepare for Monday meeting" but realize
     it's three things: book room, prepare slides, send agenda.  Press

          or cancel
        • Kills the WIP buffer
        • Restores previous window configuration

   • Updating Items Without Refiling

     **What this is:** A way to reconfigure existing GTD items (change
     their category, properties, or details) without moving them to a
     different location in your files.

     **Who needs it:** Anyone who wants to change how an item is
     organized while keeping it where it is - perfect for items already
     in projects, or when you like your current file organization.

     **Your first use (30 seconds):**

     You're looking at your agenda and see a single action that should
     actually be delegated.  But it's already in a specific project file
     and you want it to stay there:

       1. In agenda view, put point on the item
       2. Type: ‘C-u M-x org-gtd-clarify-agenda-item’
       3. Make your changes in the clarify buffer
       4. Type: ‘M-x org-gtd-organize’
       5. Type: ‘-n’ to toggle "Update in place (no refile)"
       6. Choose: ‘d’ for Delegate
       7. Fill in delegation details
       8. Done - item is updated but stays in its current location

     **How it works:**

     Normally when you organize an item, org-gtd moves (refiles) it to
     the appropriate GTD type location.  But sometimes you want to
     change the configuration without moving the item.

     There are two ways to trigger this:

     *Via prefix argument:*
        • ‘C-u M-x org-gtd-clarify-item’ - Clarify item at point without
          refiling
        • ‘C-u M-x org-gtd-clarify-agenda-item’ - Clarify agenda item
          without refiling

     *Via transient toggle:*
        • During organization, press ‘-n’ in the ‘org-gtd-organize’ menu
          to toggle "Update in place (no refile)"
        • The toggle is only available when NOT processing the inbox
          (inbox items must be refiled)

     When the skip-refile flag is set, organizing the item will:
        • Apply all the same configuration (properties, tags, hooks)
        • Update the item in its current location
        • NOT move it to a different file or heading

     **Common scenarios:**

     *Reconfiguring project tasks:*
        • Task is already in the right project file
        • You want to change it from single action to delegated
        • Use skip-refile to update without moving

     *Adjusting agenda items:*
        • Item appears in your daily agenda
        • You realize it needs different properties (change deadline,
          add delegation, etc.)
        • Use skip-refile to update configuration in place

     *Organizing items in custom locations:*
        • You've organized items in a specific way outside
          ‘org-gtd-directory’
        • You want to apply GTD types but preserve your file structure
        • Use skip-refile to maintain your organization

     **What stays the same vs what changes:**

     *Changes applied:*
        • GTD type (ORG_GTD property)
        • TODO keyword state
        • Properties (delegation info, dates, etc.)
        • Tags
        • All organize hooks

     *Preserved:*
        • File location
        • Position within file
        • Parent heading (for tasks in projects)
        • Sibling relationships

     **Technical details:**

     When you set the skip-refile flag (via ‘C-u’ prefix or ‘-n’
     toggle):
        • The flag is stored in the clarify buffer as
          ‘org-gtd-clarify--skip-refile’
        • Category finalize functions check this flag
        • If set, they call ‘org-gtd-organize--update-in-place’ instead
          of refiling
        • The original heading is replaced with the configured content
          from the WIP buffer
        • Archive categories (quick-action, knowledge, trash) always
          archive regardless of this flag

     **Migration note:**

     In previous versions, there was a special command
     ‘org-gtd-delegate-item-at-point’ for delegating items without
     moving them.  This command has been removed in favor of the more
     general skip-refile mechanism:

     *OLD way (no longer available):*
          M-x org-gtd-delegate-item-at-point

     *NEW way (version 4.0+):*
          ;; From agenda or file:
          C-u M-x org-gtd-clarify-item
          ;; or
          C-u M-x org-gtd-clarify-agenda-item
          ;; Then organize and press -n toggle
          M-x org-gtd-organize
          ;; Press -n to enable skip-refile
          ;; Choose delegation

     The new approach is more flexible - it works for ANY GTD type, not
     just delegation.

6.2.11 Timestamp Commands (DWIM)
--------------------------------

These commands work from any context: org buffer or agenda view.  They
automatically detect where you are.

   • ‘org-gtd-set-timestamp’

     *When to use*: To reschedule a Calendar, Delegated, or Tickler item

     *What it does*:
        • Prompts for a new date

        • Works from org-mode headings or agenda items

     *Example*: You have a Calendar item for a meeting next week, but
     the meeting got moved.  Navigate to the item (either in org-mode or
     via the agenda), call ‘M-x org-gtd-set-timestamp’, pick the new
     date.

     *Note*: In the agenda transient (‘org-gtd-agenda-transient’), this
     is the ‘s’ "Set date" action.

        • Rewires dependencies: predecessors are connected to successors
        • Keeps the task itself (does not delete it)
        • Updates TODO states

   • ‘org-gtd-project-trash-task’

     *When to use*: To completely remove a task from all projects

     *What it does*:
        • Removes task from ALL projects it belongs to
        • Cleans up ALL dependency relationships
        • Marks the task as canceled (CNCL)
        • Updates TODO states in affected projects

   • ‘org-gtd-project-change-state’

     *When to use*: To change the TODO state of a task

     *What it does*:
        • Prompts for new TODO state
        • Updates the task state
        • Works from any context (org buffer, agenda, graph view)

6.2.13 Project Management Commands
----------------------------------

   • ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords-for-project-at-point’

     *When to use*: When project TODO states seem incorrect after
     dependency changes

     *What it does*:
        • Recalculates which tasks should be NEXT based on dependency
          graph
        • Updates all task keywords in the project
        • Fixes stuck projects

     *Required*: Point must be on project heading

     *Note*: This is automatically called after graph UI operations and
     text-based task management commands.  You typically only need this
     for troubleshooting edge cases.

   • ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-all-todo-keywords’

     **What it is:** Recalculates and fixes TODO/NEXT states for ALL
     projects in your GTD system at once.

     **Why you'd use it:** After making changes in external tools
     (mobile apps, web interfaces, other editors) that don't know about
     org-gtd's dependency logic, your task states might be inconsistent.
     This command makes everything sane again.

     **Who needs it:** Anyone who edits their GTD files outside of
     org-gtd (mobile apps, sync conflicts, manual edits).

     **Your first use (30 seconds):**

       1. Edit tasks on your phone/tablet/other tool
       2. Sync back to Emacs
       3. Run: ‘M-x org-gtd-projects-fix-all-todo-keywords’
       4. Done - all task states are now correct

     That's it.  No need to manually check each project.

     **Common scenarios:**

        • Completed tasks on mobile → states might be wrong → run this
        • Changed task descriptions/notes externally → run this to be
          safe
        • Sync conflict resolution → run this after fixing conflicts
        • Bulk manual edits outside org-gtd → run this
        • After migration or data import → run this

     **When to use this vs the single-project version:**

     Use ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-all-todo-keywords’ when:
        • You've worked in external tools (mobile, web, other editors)
        • You've edited multiple projects
        • You don't know which projects are affected
        • You want to fix everything at once (safest option)

     Use ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords-for-project-at-point’ when:
        • You know which specific project has issues
        • You've just edited one project in Emacs
        • You want to fix just one project quickly

     **What it does (technical):**

       1. Scans all projects in agenda files
       2. Resets active task states (TODO/NEXT → TODO)
       3. Calculates which tasks are ready based on dependencies
       4. Marks ready tasks as NEXT
       5. Preserves user-set states (WAIT, DONE, CNCL)
       6. Handles multi-project tasks correctly (AND semantics)

     **Multi-project tasks:**

     Some tasks can belong to multiple projects.  This command handles
     them safely:
        • Shared task becomes NEXT only if ready in ALL its projects
        • If ready in just some projects, stays TODO
        • WAIT states are never auto-changed

     **When NOT to use:**

        • If you only work in Emacs with org-gtd commands (automatic
          state management works)
        • If your projects look correct already
        • Before making external changes (use after, not before)

   • ‘org-gtd-project-update-all-cookies’

     **What it is:** Refreshes progress cookies on ALL project headings
     at once.

     **Why you'd use it:** Progress cookies show ‘[3/7][42%]’ on project
     headings.  While these update automatically when you change task
     states, sometimes you want to refresh everything—for example, after
     bulk changes or data migration.

     **Your first use (30 seconds):**

       1. Run: ‘M-x org-gtd-project-update-all-cookies’
       2. Done - all project headings now show accurate progress

     **What it does:**

        • Scans all projects in agenda files
        • Counts completed vs total tasks for each project
        • Updates the ‘[completed/total][percent%]’ display on each
          project heading

     **When to use:**

        • After bulk task changes outside of org-gtd
        • After data migration or import
        • During weekly review for visual refresh
        • If progress cookies look outdated

     **Configuration:**

     Progress cookies are controlled by
     ‘org-gtd-project-progress-cookie-position’:
        • ‘'end’ (default) - cookies appear at end of heading before
          tags
        • ‘'start’ - cookies appear after TODO keyword
        • ‘nil’ - cookies disabled entirely

     *See also*: *note Project Progress Cookies: Project Progress
     Cookies See Your Progress at a Glance. for detailed usage guide.

   • ‘org-gtd-tickler’

     **What it is:** Smart command to pause items with a specific review
     date (time-based reminder).

     **Why you'd use it:** You have a project or action that's a good
     idea, but not ready NOW.  You want to set it aside with a specific
     date to review it later, without losing your planning work.

     **Who needs it:** Anyone managing items that need to be deferred
     until a specific time or date.

     **Your first use (30 seconds):**

       1. Navigate to a project or action
       2. Run: ‘M-x org-gtd-tickler’
       3. Enter review date: ‘2025-12-01’
       4. Done - it disappears from your engage view until that date

     **What it does:**

     Detects what you're on:
        • Project heading → ticklers entire project with all tasks
        • Project task → ticklers the project it belongs to
        • Single action → ticklers just that action

     For projects:
        • Preserves all task states and dependencies
        • Hides everything from engage/NEXT views
        • Adds review date to your agenda
        • Skips multi-project tasks (tasks shared between projects)

     **When to use:**

        • Projects you want to start on a specific future date
        • Seasonal projects (start each year at a certain time)
        • Projects blocked by external factors with an expected
          resolution date
        • Items you want to reconsider after a specific event or
          milestone

     **Note:** For items with NO specific timeframe ("maybe someday"),
     use ‘org-gtd-someday’ instead.

   • ‘org-gtd-reactivate’

     **What it is:** Bring back tickler or someday items to their
     original active state.

     **Why you'd use it:** You're ready to work on something you
     previously set aside—either a tickler item whose review date
     arrived, or a someday item you've decided to act on.

     **Your first use (30 seconds):**

       1. Navigate to a tickler or someday item
       2. Run: ‘M-x org-gtd-reactivate’
       3. For non-project items: confirm or update each saved property
          when prompted
       4. For projects: graph view opens for review

     **What it does:**

     *For all items:*
        • Restores original ‘ORG_GTD’ value from ‘PREVIOUS_ORG_GTD’
        • Restores TODO keyword from ‘PREVIOUS_TODO’
        • Removes ‘ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP’ (tickler review date)

     *For non-project items (delegated, calendar, single actions):*
        • Prompts you to confirm or update each type-specific property
        • Example: "Delegated to [Jane Smith]: " lets you keep Jane or
          enter someone new
        • Example: "Scheduled _[2025-03-15 Sat]_: " lets you update the
          date

     *For projects:*
        • Iterates over all project tasks restoring each one
        • Recalculates NEXT tasks based on current dependencies
        • Opens project graph view for review

     **When to use:**

        • When a tickler item appears in your agenda on its review date
        • During someday/maybe review when you decide to activate an
          item
        • When you're ready to reactivate something earlier than
          scheduled
        • During weekly review when scanning tickler or someday items

     **Note:** If an item has no saved state (‘PREVIOUS_ORG_GTD’ is
     empty), reactivation will start the organize workflow so you can
     categorize it fresh.

6.2.14 Task Dependency Commands
-------------------------------

These text-based commands manage task relationships without using the
graph view.  Most users will find the graph view more intuitive (press
‘M-x org-gtd-show-project-graph’), but these commands are useful for:

   • Working in the org file directly
   • Scripting/automation
   • Preference for text-based workflows

   *Graph UI equivalents*:
   • Adding tasks with dependencies: ‘r’ (root), ‘s’ (successor), ‘b’
     (blocker)
   • Modifying relationships: ‘B’ (modify blockers), ‘S’ (modify
     dependents)
   • Viewing relationships: ‘i’ (show relationships)

   See *note Graph View Command Reference:: for the visual approach.

   • ‘org-gtd-task-add-blockers’

     *When to use*: To specify that the current task depends on other
     task(s) completing first

     *What it does*:
        • Prompts to select tasks that block the current task
        • Creates bidirectional relationships.
             • Adds selected task IDs to current task's
               ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON
             • Adds current task ID to selected tasks' ORG_GTD_BLOCKS
        • Can select multiple blockers

     *Example*:
          On task: "Get diagnosis"
          M-x org-gtd-task-add-blockers
          Select: "Make MRI appointment" and "Make orthopedist appointment"
          Result: Both appointments must complete before diagnosis can start

   • ‘org-gtd-task-remove-blockers’

     *When to use*: To remove blocking relationships from current task

     *What it does*:
        • Shows current blockers
        • Prompts to select which to remove
        • Removes bidirectional relationships

   • ‘org-gtd-task-add-dependent’

     *When to use*: To specify that another task depends on the current
     task completing

     *What it does*:
        • Prompts to select a task that depends on current task
        • Creates bidirectional relationship.
             • Adds selected task ID to current task's ORG_GTD_BLOCKS
             • Adds current task ID to selected task's
               ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON

     *Example*:
          On task: "Get project approval"
          M-x org-gtd-task-add-dependent
          Select: "Start implementation"
          Result: Implementation can't start until approval is done

   • ‘org-gtd-task-add-dependents’

     *When to use*: To specify multiple tasks that depend on the current
     task

     *What it does*:
        • Same as ‘org-gtd-task-add-dependent’ but allows multiple
          selections

   • ‘org-gtd-task-clear-relationships’

     *When to use*: To remove ALL dependency relationships from current
     task

     *What it does*:
        • Removes all ORG_GTD_BLOCKS and ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON properties
        • Updates related tasks to remove references to this task
        • Use with caution!

   • ‘org-gtd-task-show-relationships’

     *When to use*: To see what tasks are related to the current task

     *What it does*:
        • Displays in minibuffer.
             • Tasks this task depends on (blockers)
             • Tasks that depend on this task (dependents)
        • Useful for understanding dependency graph

   • ‘org-gtd-validate-project-dependencies’

     *When to use*: To check for dependency problems in a project

     *What it does*:
        • Detects broken dependency references (task IDs that don't
          exist)
        • Finds orphaned tasks (not reachable from FIRST_TASKS)
        • Identifies circular dependencies
        • Provides guidance on fixes

     *Required*: Point must be on project heading

   • ‘org-gtd-remove-task-from-project’

     *When to use*: To remove a task from a project structure

     *What it does*:
        • Removes the project ID from task's ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS
          property
        • Doesn't delete the task, just removes project association
        • Useful when reorganizing project structures

6.2.15 Area of Focus Commands
-----------------------------

   • ‘org-gtd-area-of-focus-set-on-item-at-point’

     *When to use*: To add area of focus to an existing item (not during
     organize)

     *What it does*:
        • Prompts for area from ‘org-gtd-areas-of-focus’
        • Sets CATEGORY property
        • Use this on any org heading

     *Note*: Trusts you to use it correctly (no validation)

   • ‘org-gtd-area-of-focus-set-on-agenda-item’

     *When to use*: In agenda view, to set area of focus on an item

     *What it does*:
        • Same as ‘org-gtd-area-of-focus-set-on-item-at-point’ but from
          agenda
        • Smarter: detects if you're on a project task and sets area on
          the project instead

6.3 Properties Reference (Internal Implementation)
==================================================

*For most users*: You don't need to read this section!  Use the graph
view or text-based task management commands instead.

   *This section is for*:
   • Understanding org-gtd's internal data model
   • Writing elisp automation/integration code
   • Debugging edge cases
   • Migrating data from other systems

   org-gtd uses org-mode properties to track state and relationships.
These properties are managed automatically by org-gtd commands - *you
should not edit them manually during normal use.*

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Core GTD Properties,  Next: Project Properties,  Up: Properties Reference (Internal Implementation)

6.3.1 Core GTD Properties
-------------------------

   • ORG_GTD

     *Used on*: All GTD items (projects, actions, calendar items,
     tickler items, etc.)

     *Purpose*: Identifies the type of GTD item

     *Values*:
     ‘"Projects"’
          Project heading
     ‘"Actions"’
          Project tasks and single actions
     ‘"Calendar"’
          Calendar items (appointments, deadlines)
     ‘"Tickler"’
          Items with specific review dates (time-based reminders)
     ‘"Someday"’
          Someday/maybe items (no specific timeframe)
     ‘"Delegated"’
          Delegated tasks (set in combination with DELEGATED_TO)

     *Example*:
          * My Project
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ORG_GTD: Projects
          :END:
          ** NEXT Task 1
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ORG_GTD: Actions
          :END:

     *Note*: This property is how org-gtd identifies items.  Don't
     modify manually unless you understand the implications.

   • ORG_GTD_REFILE

     *Used on*: Category headings that serve as refile targets

     *Purpose*: Marks a heading as a refile target for org-gtd's
     optional refile system (see *note Refiling section: Refiling to the
     appropriate area.)

     *Values*:
     ‘"Projects"’
          Target for refiling projects
     ‘"Actions"’
          Target for refiling single actions
     ‘"Calendar"’
          Target for refiling calendar items
     ‘"Tickler"’
          Target for refiling tickler items (time-based reminders)
     ‘"Someday"’
          Target for refiling someday/maybe items
     ‘"Habits"’
          Target for refiling habits

     *Multivalue support*: Values can be space-separated to accept
     multiple types.  For example, ‘Actions Projects’ makes a heading a
     valid target for both single actions and projects.

     *Example*:
          * Projects         <-- Can be at any level in any file
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ORG_GTD_REFILE: Projects
          :END:

          * Work/Development Projects   <-- Can have multiple targets per type
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ORG_GTD_REFILE: Projects
          :END:

          * Work Tasks      <-- Accepts multiple types
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ORG_GTD_REFILE: Actions Projects
          :END:

     *How it's set*:
        • Automatically created by ‘org-gtd-upgrade-v3-to-v4’ (renames
          ORG_GTD on level 1 headings)
        • Manually when creating custom refile targets
        • Via ‘org-entry-put’ in elisp: ‘(org-entry-put nil
          "ORG_GTD_REFILE" "Projects")’

     *Important notes*:
        • Org-gtd merges these targets with your ‘org-refile-targets’
          configuration
        • Can exist at ANY level in ANY file in ‘org-agenda-files’
        • You can have multiple refile targets for the same category
          type
        • A single heading can accept multiple types (space-separated
          values)
        • Your ‘org-refile-targets’ appear first, then ‘ORG_GTD_REFILE’
          targets

6.3.2 Project Properties
------------------------

   • ORG_GTD_FIRST_TASKS

     *Used on*: Project headings

     *Purpose*: Identifies which tasks can start immediately (have no
     dependencies)

     *Format*: Space-separated list of task IDs

     *Example*:
          * Software Release
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ORG_GTD: Projects
          :ORG_GTD_FIRST_TASKS: abc123 def456
          :END:

     This means tasks with IDs "abc123" and "def456" can both start
     immediately (parallel execution).

     *How it's set*:
        • Automatically when organizing a project
        • Automatically by graph view ‘r’ (add root task) and ‘b’ (add
          blocker as root)
        • Programmatically via ‘org-entry-add-to-multivalued-property’

     *For interactive use*: Use graph view commands instead of editing
     this property directly.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Task Dependency Properties,  Next: Calendar and Time Properties,  Prev: Project Properties,  Up: Properties Reference (Internal Implementation)

6.3.3 Task Dependency Properties
--------------------------------

   • ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON

     *Used on*: Project tasks

     *Purpose*: Lists task IDs that must complete before this task can
     start

     *Format*: Space-separated list of task IDs

     *Example*:
          ** NEXT Get project approval
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ID: task-001
          :ORG_GTD: Actions
          :ORG_GTD_BLOCKS: task-002 task-003
          :END:
          ** TODO Design solution
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ID: task-002
          :ORG_GTD: Actions
          :ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON: task-001
          :ORG_GTD_BLOCKS: task-004
          :END:
          ** TODO Setup infrastructure
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ID: task-003
          :ORG_GTD: Actions
          :ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON: task-001
          :ORG_GTD_BLOCKS: task-004
          :END:
          ** TODO Implement feature
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ID: task-004
          :ORG_GTD: Actions
          :ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON: task-002 task-003
          :END:

     In this example:
        • Task 001 (approval) starts first
        • Tasks 002 (design) and 003 (infrastructure) can run in
          parallel after approval
        • Task 004 (implement) waits for both 002 and 003 to complete

     *How it's set*:
        • Graph view: ‘s’ (add successor), ‘b’ (add blocker), ‘B’
          (modify blockers)
        • Text commands: ‘org-gtd-task-add-blockers’,
          ‘org-gtd-task-add-dependent’
        • Programmatically: ‘org-gtd-dependencies-create’ (maintains
          bidirectional relationships)

     *For interactive use*: Use graph view or text-based task commands
     instead of editing this property directly.

   • ORG_GTD_BLOCKS

     *Used on*: Project tasks

     *Purpose*: Lists task IDs that depend on this task completing
     (inverse of DEPENDS_ON)

     *Format*: Space-separated list of task IDs

     *Relationship*: If task A has ‘ORG_GTD_BLOCKS: B C’, then:
        • Task B should have ‘ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON: A’
        • Task C should have ‘ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON: A’

     *How it's set*:
        • Automatically maintained when setting ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON
          (bidirectional)
        • Programmatically via ‘org-gtd-dependencies-create’ (handles
          bidirectional updates)

     *For interactive use*: Use graph view or text-based task commands -
     they maintain the bidirectional relationship automatically.

   • ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS

     *Used on*: Tasks

     *Purpose*: Lists project IDs this task belongs to (supports
     multi-project tasks)

     *Format*: Space-separated list of project IDs

     *Note*: Currently org-gtd creates one project per task, but this
     property supports future multi-project features.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Calendar and Time Properties,  Next: Delegation Properties,  Prev: Task Dependency Properties,  Up: Properties Reference (Internal Implementation)

6.3.4 Calendar and Time Properties
----------------------------------

   • ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP

     *Used on*: Calendar items, delegated items

     *Purpose*: Stores the appointment time or follow-up date

     *Format*: Org timestamp (inactive timestamp)

     *Example*:
          * Doctor appointment
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ORG_GTD: Calendar
          :ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP: [2025-10-15 Wed 14:00]
          :END:

     *Why not use SCHEDULED*: org-gtd uses a custom property to
     distinguish between "do this at this time" (GTD calendar items) and
     "start working on this sometime after this date" (org-mode
     scheduling).

     *How it's set*:
        • Automatically by ‘org-gtd-organize’ when organizing items as
          calendar items
        • Programmatically when creating calendar items

     *For interactive use*: Use ‘org-gtd-organize’ to change calendar
     items.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Delegation Properties,  Next: Habit Properties,  Prev: Calendar and Time Properties,  Up: Properties Reference (Internal Implementation)

6.3.5 Delegation Properties
---------------------------

   • DELEGATED_TO

     *Used on*: Delegated items

     *Purpose*: Stores the name of person/team the task is delegated to

     *Format*: String (person's name)

     *Example*:
          * Review document
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ORG_GTD: Delegated
          :DELEGATED_TO: Alice Smith
          :ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP: [2025-10-18 Fri]
          :END:

     *How it's set*:
        • Automatically by ‘org-gtd-organize’ when organizing as
          delegated item
        • Automatically by ‘org-gtd-delegate-agenda-item’ from agenda
        • Programmatically when creating delegated items

     *For interactive use*: Use ‘org-gtd-delegate-agenda-item’ or
     organize flow.

     *Customization*: Set ‘org-gtd-delegate-read-func’ to customize how
     names are entered (e.g., for completion).


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Habit Properties,  Next: Area of Focus Properties,  Prev: Delegation Properties,  Up: Properties Reference (Internal Implementation)

6.3.6 Habit Properties
----------------------

   • STYLE

     *Used on*: Habits

     *Purpose*: Identifies item as an org-mode habit

     *Value*: ‘"habit"’

     *Example*:
          * TODO Exercise
          SCHEDULED: <2025-10-11 Fri .+1d>
          :PROPERTIES:
          :STYLE: habit
          :END:

     *Note*: This is a standard org-mode habit property.  See org-mode
     documentation for habit repeat patterns and configuration.

6.3.7 Area of Focus Properties
------------------------------

   • CATEGORY

     *Used on*: All items (when using areas of focus)

     *Purpose*: Identifies which area of focus (GTD Horizon 2) an item
     belongs to

     *Format*: String matching value from ‘org-gtd-areas-of-focus’

     *Example*:
          * Finish quarterly report
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ORG_GTD: Actions
          :CATEGORY: Work
          :END:

     *When to set*:
        • During organize, if ‘org-gtd-set-area-of-focus’ is in
          ‘org-gtd-organize-hooks’
        • Manually with ‘org-gtd-area-of-focus-set-on-item-at-point’
        • From agenda with ‘org-gtd-area-of-focus-set-on-agenda-item’

     *Use*: Filter views by area with ‘org-gtd-reflect-area-of-focus’ or
     custom views.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Standard Org Properties Used by org-gtd,  Prev: Area of Focus Properties,  Up: Properties Reference (Internal Implementation)

6.3.8 Standard Org Properties Used by org-gtd
---------------------------------------------

   • ID

     *Used on*: All GTD items

     *Purpose*: Unique identifier for the item (org-mode standard)

     *Format*: Auto-generated UUID

     *Note*: org-gtd relies heavily on IDs for task relationships.
     Don't delete ID properties.

   • *TODO* keyword

     *Not a property, but a heading keyword*

     *Values used by org-gtd*:
        • Value from ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’'s ‘todo’ key (default
          "TODO")
        • Value from ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’'s ‘next’ key (default
          "NEXT")
        • Value from ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’'s ‘wait’ key (default
          "WAIT")
        • Value from ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’'s ‘done’ key (default
          "DONE")
        • Value from ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’'s ‘canceled’ key (default
          "CNCL")

   • SCHEDULED (org-mode standard)

     *Used on*: Habits primarily

     *Purpose*: For org-mode habits, defines repeat pattern

     *Note*: org-gtd uses ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP for calendar items instead
     of SCHEDULED to maintain GTD semantics.

   • DEADLINE (org-mode standard)

     *Used on*: Items with hard deadlines

     *Purpose*: Mark items that must be done by a specific date

     *Note*: org-gtd respects org-mode deadlines in all views and oops
     checks.

6.4 Troubleshooting Projects
============================

This section covers how to fix problems with project dependencies.  *You
should rarely need this* - the graph view and task management commands
handle dependencies correctly.  If you find yourself needing these
troubleshooting steps frequently, that indicates a bug - please file an
issue!

* Menu:

* Fixing Broken Dependencies::
* When Manual Property Editing is Needed::
* Common Problems and Solutions::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Fixing Broken Dependencies,  Next: When Manual Property Editing is Needed,  Up: Troubleshooting Projects

6.4.1 Fixing Broken Dependencies
--------------------------------

If you encounter dependency problems (circular dependencies, broken
references, orphaned tasks):

  1. *Validate project structure*:
        • Put point on project heading
        • Run ‘M-x org-gtd-validate-project-dependencies’
        • This detects broken references, orphaned tasks, and circular
          dependencies
        • Follow the guidance provided

  2. *Visual inspection with graph view*:
        • Run ‘M-x org-gtd-show-project-graph’
        • Visual inspection often makes problems obvious
        • Missing arrows?  Use ‘s’ to add successor or ‘B’ to add
          blockers
        • Wrong arrows?  Use ‘B’ or ‘S’ to uncheck incorrect
          relationships
        • Use ‘i’ to inspect a task's current relationships

  3. *Clear and rebuild*: If task relationships are completely
     corrupted:
        • In graph view: Select task, use ‘B’ and ‘S’ to adjust
          blockers/dependents
        • Or in text: Run ‘M-x org-gtd-task-clear-relationships’
        • Rebuild using graph view: ‘s’ (add successor), ‘b’ (add
          blocker)


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: When Manual Property Editing is Needed,  Next: Common Problems and Solutions,  Prev: Fixing Broken Dependencies,  Up: Troubleshooting Projects

6.4.2 When Manual Property Editing is Needed
--------------------------------------------

*You should never need to manually edit properties during normal use.*

   The ONLY cases where manual property editing might be necessary:

  1. *Writing elisp automation/integration code*
        • See *note Properties Reference: Properties Reference (Internal
          Implementation). for property documentation
        • Use programmatic functions: ‘org-gtd-dependencies-create’,
          ‘org-entry-add-to-multivalued-property’, etc.
        • Never manipulate properties directly from interactive commands

  2. *Debugging org-gtd internals*
        • If you suspect a bug in org-gtd's property management
        • Compare properties with graph view to identify discrepancies
        • File an issue with details!

  3. *Migrating data from another system*
        • If importing projects from external tools
        • Batch property updates may be more efficient
        • Validate with ‘org-gtd-validate-project-dependencies’
          afterward

  4. *Emergency recovery from data corruption*
        • Only as last resort if graph view and commands fail
        • After manual edits, run
          ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords-for-project-at-point’ (one
          project)
        • Or run ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-all-todo-keywords’ to fix all
          projects at once
        • Consider this a bug and file an issue

   *If you find yourself manually editing properties regularly*, that
indicates missing features.  Please file an issue describing your
workflow - we'll add the missing commands!


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Common Problems and Solutions,  Prev: When Manual Property Editing is Needed,  Up: Troubleshooting Projects

6.4.3 Common Problems and Solutions
-----------------------------------

   • Project Shows No NEXT Tasks (Stuck Project)

     *Symptom*: Project has incomplete tasks but none are NEXT.

     *Diagnosis*:
        • Run ‘M-x org-gtd-show-project-graph’
        • Look for blue boxes (NEXT tasks)
        • If no blue boxes, check for:
             • Circular dependencies (arrows forming a loop)
             • All tasks waiting on incomplete tasks
             • Missing ORG_GTD_FIRST_TASKS property

     *Solution*:
        • Fix circular dependencies: Use ‘B’ to remove incorrect blocker
          relationships
        • Add root tasks: Use ‘r’ to create tasks that can start
          immediately
        • Run ‘org-gtd-validate-project-dependencies’ for detailed
          diagnosis

   • Too Many NEXT Tasks

     *Symptom*: Project shows 10+ blue boxes in graph view.

     *Diagnosis*: Tasks that should be dependent are independent.

     *Solution*:
        • In graph view, identify tasks that should depend on others
        • Select a task, use ‘B’ to add blockers it should wait for
        • Or use ‘s’ from an earlier task to add a successor that should
          come later

   • Task Won't Advance to NEXT

     *Symptom*: Completed a task, but dependent task still shows TODO
     (orange).

     *Diagnosis*:
        • In graph view, select the orange task
        • Press ‘i’ to show relationships
        • Check if all blockers are actually DONE

     *Solution*:
        • If blockers are DONE but showing as blocking: Press ‘g’ to
          refresh graph
        • If blocker shouldn't block this task: Use ‘B’ to modify
          blockers and uncheck it
        • If many wrong dependencies: Run
          ‘org-gtd-task-clear-relationships’, rebuild with ‘s~/~b’

   • Task States Inconsistent After External Edits

     *Symptom*: After editing on mobile app or resolving sync conflicts,
     task states don't match dependencies.

     *Examples*:
        • Tasks marked NEXT but blocked by incomplete dependencies
        • Tasks stuck in TODO when they should be NEXT
        • Multiple projects showing inconsistent states

     *Diagnosis*:
        • External tools (mobile apps, web interfaces) don't understand
          org-gtd dependency logic
        • Manual edits or sync conflicts disrupted task states
        • Affects all projects if you edited multiple files

     *Solution*:
        • For one project: Put point on project heading, run ‘M-x
          org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords-for-project-at-point’
        • For all projects: Run ‘M-x
          org-gtd-projects-fix-all-todo-keywords’

     *Recommended workflow after mobile edits*:
       1. Sync files to Emacs
       2. Run ‘M-x org-gtd-projects-fix-all-todo-keywords’
       3. Verify with ‘M-x org-gtd-engage’ - should show correct NEXT
          tasks

Build custom agenda views in minutes.  The View DSL lets you filter your
GTD items by type, time, area of focus, and more--using simple
declarative syntax instead of writing skip functions.

6.5.1 Your First Custom View in 60 Seconds
------------------------------------------

Try this now:

  1. Evaluate this code (select it and run ‘M-x eval-region’):

          (org-gtd-view-show
           '((name . "My Delegated Items")
             (type . delegated)))

  2. An agenda view appears showing all your delegated items

  3. Try changing ‘delegated’ to ‘next-action’ and re-evaluate--now you
     see NEXT actions

   That's it.  You just created a custom view.  The rest of this section
shows you what else you can filter by.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Understanding View Specs,  Next: Common Patterns (3),  Prev: Your First Custom View in 60 Seconds,  Up: View DSL Filter Reference

6.5.2 Understanding View Specs
------------------------------

A view spec is a simple list describing what you want to see:

     '((name . "View Name")     ;; What appears in the agenda header
       (type . delegated)       ;; Filter: show only delegated items
       (when . past))           ;; Filter: only items with past dates

   *Mental model:* Think of each line as a filter.  Items must pass ALL
filters to appear.  ‘(type . delegated)’ means "only delegated items".
Adding ‘(when . past)’ means "only delegated items whose check-in date
has passed".

   • Combining Filters

     Filters stack with AND logic:

          ;; Delegated items + past due = missed check-ins
          '((name . "Missed Check-ins")
            (type . delegated)
            (when . past))

          ;; Projects + specific area = focused view
          '((name . "Work Projects")
            (type . active-project)
            (area-of-focus . "Work"))

   • Multi-Block Views

     Show multiple filtered lists in one view:

          '((name . "My Dashboard")
            (blocks . (((name . "Calendar Today")
                        (type . calendar)
                        (when . today))
                       ((name . "Delegated Due")
                        (type . delegated)
                        (when . past))
                       ((name . "NEXT Actions")
                        (type . next-action)))))

     Each block is its own filter.  The view shows them stacked as
     separate sections.

6.5.3 Common Patterns
---------------------

   • Weekly Review View

     See what needs attention:

          (defun my-weekly-review ()
            "Show stuck projects, missed items, and recent completions."
            (interactive)
            (org-gtd-view-show

                           (type . delegated)
                           (when . today))
                          ((name . "Ready to Work On")
                           (type . next-action)))))))

   • Area of Focus View

     Filter everything by life area:

          (defun my-work-view ()
            "All work-related active items."
            (interactive)
            (org-gtd-view-show

6.5.4 Filter Reference
----------------------

The following sections document all available filters.  Use them to
build the exact view you need.

   • View Structure

     A GTD view is defined as an alist with filters at the top level:

          ;; Simple view with filters at top level
          '((name . "View Name")
            (type . delegated)
            (when . past))

     Multiple filters create AND logic (all must match).

        • Multi-Block Views

          For complex views with multiple sections (like the engage
          view), use ‘blocks’:

               '((name . "My Custom Dashboard")
                 (blocks . (((name . "Today's Calendar")
                             (block-type . calendar-day))
                            ((name . "Items Due Today")
                             (type . delegated)
                             (when . today))
                            ((name . "All NEXT Actions")
                             (type . next-action)))))

          Each block is its own view spec.  Blocks are displayed in
          order as separate agenda sections.

        • Block Types

          Special ‘block-type’ values control how blocks are rendered:

          ‘calendar-day’
               Native org-agenda day view filtered to Calendar and Habit
               items only
          ‘todo’
               Native org-agenda todo block (requires ‘todo-keyword’)
          _default_
               tags block with skip function (when no block-type
               specified)

        • Native Blocks (Escape Hatch)

          Have you ever wanted your NEXT actions sorted by priority?  Or
          needed a custom skip function for a specialized workflow?  The
          DSL handles most cases, but org-agenda has decades of
          features.  When you hit its limits, ‘native’ blocks let you
          drop down to raw org-agenda syntax--without abandoning the DSL
          entirely.

             • When You'll Need This

               You're building a view and think: "I wish I could sort
               these by effort" or "I need my custom skip function
               here."  The DSL doesn't support sorting yet.  What do you
               do?

               You have two choices:
                 1. Write the whole view in ‘org-agenda-custom-commands’
                    (losing DSL benefits)
                 2. Use a ‘native’ block for just that section (keeping
                    DSL for the rest)

               Option 2 is what this section teaches.

             • Your First Native Block

               Start with something you know.  This DSL block shows NEXT
               actions:

                    ((type . next-action))

               Here's the equivalent as a native block:

                    ((native . (tags-todo "LEVEL>0+ORG_GTD=\"Actions\"/NEXT" nil)))

               The format is ‘(BLOCK-TYPE MATCH-STRING
               SETTINGS)’--exactly what ‘org-agenda-custom-commands’
               uses.  Try evaluating both in a multi-block view:

                    (org-gtd-view-show
                     '((name . "Comparing DSL and Native")
                       (blocks . (((name . "DSL Version")
                                   (type . next-action))
                                  ((native . (tags-todo "LEVEL>0+ORG_GTD=\"Actions\"/NEXT"
                                              ((org-agenda-overriding-header "Native Version")))))))))

               They show the same items.  The native block is more
               verbose, but it unlocks org-agenda's full power.

             • Adding Custom Sorting

               Now the payoff.  Want priority sorting?  Add it to the
               settings list:

                    ((native . (tags-todo "+@work/NEXT"
                                ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down effort-up))
                                 (org-agenda-overriding-header "Work by Priority")))))

               The settings list can include any org-agenda variable.
               Common ones:
                  • ‘org-agenda-sorting-strategy’ -- Sort by priority,
                    effort, alphabetically
                  • ‘org-agenda-skip-function’ -- Your custom skip logic
                  • ‘org-agenda-prefix-format’ -- Custom prefix display

             • Mixing DSL and Native

               The real power is mixing them.  Use DSL for simple
               blocks, native for complex ones:

                    (org-gtd-view-show
                     '((name . "Mixed Dashboard")
                       (blocks . (((type . delegated)                               ; DSL: simple
                                   (when . past))
                                  ((native . (tags-todo "+urgent"                   ; Native: sorted
                                              ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(effort-up))
                                               (org-agenda-overriding-header "Urgent by Effort")))))
                                  ((type . next-action))))))                        ; DSL: simple

               Each block is independent.  Use whatever syntax fits that
               block's needs.

             • Native Block Types

               The BLOCK-TYPE (first element) determines what kind of
               agenda block you get:

               Block Type    What It Shows
               -------------------------------------------------------
               ‘agenda’      Calendar/timeline (like daily view)
               ‘todo’        TODO items by keyword
               ‘tags’        Items matching tag/property expression
               ‘tags-todo’   Like ‘tags’ but only TODO items
               ‘search’      Full-text search results

             • Quick Reference

               *Syntax*:
                    ((native . (BLOCK-TYPE MATCH-STRING SETTINGS)))

               *Rules*:
                  • Only valid inside a ‘blocks’ list
                  • Other DSL keys in the same block spec are ignored
                  • Settings is an alist of ‘(org-agenda-variable
                    value)’ pairs

               *When to use*: Custom sorting, skip functions,
               specialized org-agenda settings, or migrating complex
               views incrementally

6.5.6 Time-based Filters
------------------------

Filter by timestamps, deadlines, and scheduled dates.

   • Semantic Time: ‘(when . VALUE)’

     The ‘when’ filter provides semantic time filtering that
     automatically uses the correct timestamp property for each GTD item
     type:

        • For ‘delegated’ and ‘calendar’ types: checks
          ‘ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP’
        • For ‘tickler’ type: checks the tickler review date

     Values: ‘today’, ‘past’, ‘future’

     *Example*: Delegated items due today:
          '((name . "Delegated Check-ins Today")
            (type . delegated)
            (when . today))

     *Example*: Missed calendar appointments:
          '((name . "Missed Appointments")
            (type . calendar)
            (when . past))

     *Example*: Upcoming delegated check-ins:
          '((name . "Upcoming Delegated")
            (type . delegated)
            (when . future))

   • Deadline: ‘(deadline . VALUE)’

     Filter by org-mode DEADLINE.

     Values: ‘past’, ‘future’, ‘today’

     *Example*:
          '((name . "Overdue Items")
            (deadline . past))

   • Scheduled: ‘(scheduled . VALUE)’

     Filter by org-mode SCHEDULED.

     Values: ‘past’, ‘future’, ‘today’

6.5.7 *TODO* Keyword Filters
----------------------------

Filter by TODO state.

   *Note*: The ‘type’ filter automatically includes the correct TODO
keyword for each type (e.g., ‘next-action’ includes ‘NEXT’, ‘delegated’
includes ‘WAIT’).  Use these filters only when you need explicit
control.

   • ‘(todo . ("KEYWORD1" "KEYWORD2"))’

     *Matches*: Items with any of the specified TODO keywords

     *Use case*: Show specific states

     *Example*: Show only NEXT actions:
          '((name . "NEXT Actions Only")
            (todo . ("NEXT")))

     *Example*: Show NEXT and WAIT:
          '((name . "Active and Waiting")
            (todo . ("NEXT" "WAIT")))

   • ‘(done . VALUE)’

     *Matches*: Items with done TODO states (right side of ‘|’ in
     keyword sequence)

     *Values*:
     ‘t’
          Any done item, regardless of when closed
     ‘NUMBER’
          Done in last NUMBER days (e.g., ‘14’ for last 2 weeks)
     ‘today’
          Done today
     ‘recent’
          Done in last 7 days
     ‘past-day’
          Done in last day
     ‘past-week’
          Done in last week
     ‘past-month’
          Done in last month
     ‘past-year’
          Done in last year

     *Use case*: Show completed items, optionally filtered by when they
     were completed

     *Example*: All completed items:
          '((name . "Completed Items")
            (done . t))

     *Example*: Items completed this week:
          '((name . "Completed This Week")
            (done . past-week))

     *Example*: Items completed in the last 14 days:
          '((name . "Completed in Last 2 Weeks")
            (done . 14))

     *Example*: Items completed today:
          '((name . "Completed Today")
            (done . today))

---------------------------

Filter by life area:

   • ‘(area-of-focus . "AREA")’

     *Matches*: Items with ‘CATEGORY="AREA"’

     *Use case*: Focus on specific life area

     *Example*:
          '((name . "Work Items")
            (area-of-focus . "Work"))

     *Example*: Work projects only:

            (tags . ("@home" "@errands")))

   • ‘(tags-match . "PATTERN")’

     *Matches*: Items matching org-mode tag expression pattern

     *Use case*: Complex tag queries

     *Example*: All items with context tags (tags starting with @):
          '((name . "Context-Tagged Items")
            (tags-match . "{^@}"))

     *Org tag expressions*:
     ‘"tag1|tag2"’
          Has tag1 OR tag2
     ‘"tag1&tag2"’
          Has tag1 AND tag2
     ‘"{^@}"’
          Has any tag starting with @

--------------------------------------------

Filter by task metadata useful for "quick wins", "deep work", and triage
views.

   • ‘(priority . VALUE)’

     *Matches*: Items with matching priority

     *Forms*:
     ‘(priority . A)’
          Single value--matches priority A
     ‘(priority . (A B))’
          List--matches priority A OR B
     ‘(priority . (>= B))’

     ‘(priority . nil)’
          Items with no priority set

     *Comparison operators*: ‘<’, ‘>’, ‘<=’, ‘>=’

     *Note*: A is highest priority (A > B > C). Respects
     ‘org-priority-highest’ and ‘org-priority-lowest’ for custom ranges.

     *Example*: High priority actions:
          '((name . "High Priority")
            (type . next-action)
            (priority . A))

     *Example*: Important items (A or B):
          '((name . "Important Tasks")
            (type . next-action)
            (priority . (A B)))

     *Example*: All items B or higher:
          '((name . "Priority B+")
            (type . next-action)
            (priority . (>= B)))

     *Example*: Triage items missing priority:
          '((name . "Needs Priority")
            (type . next-action)
            (priority . nil))

   • ‘(effort . SPEC)’

     *Matches*: Items with matching Effort property

     *Forms*:
     ‘(effort . (< "0:30"))’
          Under 30 minutes
     ‘(effort . (> "1:00"))’
          Over 1 hour
     ‘(effort . (between "0:15" "1:00"))’
          Range (inclusive)
     ‘(effort . nil)’
          Items with no effort estimate

     *Duration formats* (all org-mode formats supported):
     ‘"3:12"’
          H:MM
     ‘"1:23:45"’
          H:MM:SS
     ‘"1d3h5min"’
          Units (d, h, min)
     ‘"30"’
          Bare number (minutes)

     *Example*: Quick wins (under 15 minutes):
          '((name . "Quick Wins")
            (type . next-action)
            (effort . (< "15min")))

     *Example*: Deep work items (1-2 hours):
          '((name . "Deep Work")
            (type . next-action)
            (effort . (between "1:00" "2:00")))

     *Example*: Triage items missing effort:
          '((name . "Needs Effort Estimate")
            (type . next-action)
            (effort . nil))

   • ‘(clocked . SPEC)’

     *Matches*: Items with matching total clocked time

     *Forms*:
     ‘(clocked . (< "0:30"))’
          Less than 30 minutes clocked
     ‘(clocked . (> "2:00"))’
          More than 2 hours invested
     ‘(clocked . (between "0:30" "2:00"))’
          Range (inclusive)
     ‘(clocked . nil)’
          Items with no time clocked (0 minutes)

     *Use case*: Find items you've already invested time in, or items
     you haven't started yet.

     *Example*: Items with significant time invested:
          '((name . "Deep in Progress")
            (type . next-action)
            (clocked . (> "1:00")))

     *Example*: Not started yet:
          '((name . "Not Started")
            (type . next-action)
            (clocked . nil))

     *Example*: Focus work (high priority, time invested):
          '((name . "Focus Work")
            (type . next-action)
            (priority . (>= B))
            (clocked . (> "0:30")))

   • ‘(last-clocked-out . SPEC)’

     *Matches*: Items based on when they were last clocked out

     *Forms*:
     ‘(last-clocked-out . (> "2d"))’
          Not worked on in 2+ days
     ‘(last-clocked-out . (>= "2d"))’
          Not worked on in 2+ days (inclusive)
     ‘(last-clocked-out . (< "1w"))’
          Worked on within past week
     ‘(last-clocked-out . (<= "1w"))’
          Worked on in past week (inclusive)
     ‘(last-clocked-out . nil)’
          Never clocked

     *Duration formats*:
     ‘"2d"’
          2 days
     ‘"1w"’
          1 week
     ‘"3h"’
          3 hours
     ‘"30m"’
          30 minutes

     *Project handling*: For project headings, automatically checks all
     tasks in the project and uses the most recent clock-out time.

     *Example*: Find stale projects not worked on in a week:
          '((name . "Stale Projects")
            (type . project)
            (last-clocked-out . (> "1w")))

     *Example*: Find items never started:
          '((name . "Never Started")
            (type . next-action)
            (last-clocked-out . nil))

6.5.14 View Configuration Options
---------------------------------

These options control how the view is displayed:

   • ‘(block-type . TYPE)’

     *Purpose*: Control how a block is rendered

     *Values*:
     ‘calendar-day’
          Native org-agenda day view filtered to Calendar and Habit
          items
     ‘todo’
          Native org-agenda todo block (requires ‘todo-keyword’)
     _omit_
          Default tags block with skip function

     *Use case*: When you need native agenda features (time grid,
     habits, etc.)

     *Example*: Multi-block view with calendar:
          '((name . "My Dashboard")
            (blocks . (((name . "Today's Schedule")
                        (block-type . calendar-day))

                        (type . delegated)
                        (when . today)))))

   • ‘(blocks . BLOCK-LIST)’

     *Purpose*: Create a multi-section view with multiple blocks

     *Format*: List of view specs, each with its own name and filters

     *Example*:
          '((name . "Review Dashboard")
            (blocks . (((name . "Stuck Projects")
                        (type . stuck-project))
                       ((name . "Missed Delegated")
                        (type . delegated)
                        (when . past))
                       ((name . "Upcoming Calendar")
                        (type . calendar)
                        (when . future)))))

   • Prefix DSL: Customizing the Task Prefix Column

     When you look at your engage view, you see context information on
     the left of each task--like the project name.  The Prefix DSL lets
     you control what appears there using a simple fallback chain.

     *Mental model:* Think of the prefix like a label maker.  You
     specify what you _want_ to show, in order of preference.  org-gtd
     tries each option until one has a value.

        • Your First Prefix in 60 Seconds

          Try this now (evaluate with ‘M-x eval-region’):

               (org-gtd-view-show
                '((name . "Tasks with Context")
                  (prefix . (project area-of-focus "—"))
                  (type . next-action)))

          You'll see NEXT actions with:
             • The project name (if the task is in a project)
             • Or the area of focus (if no project, but area is set)
             • Or a dash "—" (if neither is available)

          That's the fallback chain in action.

        • ‘(prefix . (ELEMENT ...))’

          *Purpose*: Control what context appears before each task in
          the view

          *Format*: A list of elements, tried in order.  First non-empty
          value wins.

          *Available elements*:
          ‘project’
               The project heading this task belongs to
          ‘area-of-focus’
               The ‘CATEGORY’ property (your GTD area of focus)
          ‘file-name’
               The base name of the file containing the task
          ‘"literal string"’
               Any quoted string (used as fallback)

          *Example*: Show project, fallback to area, then to literal
          text:
               '((name . "My View")
                 (prefix . (project area-of-focus "No Context"))
                 (type . next-action))

          *Example*: Just show the project name (or nothing):
               '((name . "Project Tasks")
                 (prefix . (project))
                 (type . next-action))

          *Example*: Tickler items labeled "Incubated":
               '((name . "Tickler Items")
                 (prefix . ("Incubated"))
                 (type . tickler))

        • ‘(prefix-width . N)’

          *Purpose*: Control how many characters the prefix column uses

          *Default*: Uses ‘org-gtd-prefix-width’ (default: 12)

          *Note*: Long values are truncated with "…".  Short values are
          padded with spaces.

          *Example*: Extra space for long project names:
               '((name . "Wide Prefix View")
                 (prefix . (project area-of-focus))
                 (prefix-width . 20)
                 (type . next-action))

        • Prefix Inheritance in Multi-Block Views

          When you define ‘prefix’ at the view level, all blocks inherit
          it:

               '((name . "My Dashboard")
                 (prefix . (project area-of-focus "—"))  ;; All blocks use this
                 (prefix-width . 15)
                 (blocks . (((name . "Calendar Today")
                             (type . calendar)
                             (when . today))
                            ((name . "NEXT Actions")
                             (type . next-action)))))

          Individual blocks can override the inherited prefix:

               '((name . "Mixed Prefixes")
                 (prefix . (project))  ;; Default for blocks
                 (blocks . (((name . "Projects")
                             (prefix . ("Project"))  ;; Override: literal label
                             (type . active-project))
                            ((name . "NEXT Actions")
                             ;; Uses inherited (project) prefix
                             (type . next-action)))))

        • Low-Level: ‘(prefix-format . FORMAT-STRING)’

          For advanced users who need full control, you can specify the
          raw org-agenda prefix format string.  This bypasses the prefix
          DSL.

          *Example*:
               '((name . "Custom Format")
                 (prefix-format . " %i %-12:(org-gtd-agenda--prefix-format 12) ")
                 (blocks . (((name . "NEXT Actions")
                             (type . next-action)))))

          Most users should use ‘(prefix . ...)’ instead.

   • ‘(view-type . agenda)’

     *Purpose*: Create a day/week org-agenda view instead of a tags
     block

     *Use case*: When you want a standard day/week agenda view

     *Example*:
          '((name . "Weekly Agenda")
            (view-type . agenda)
            (agenda-span . 7))

   • ‘(agenda-span . N)’

     *Purpose*: Number of days to show in agenda view

     *Default*: 1

     *Requires*: ‘(view-type . agenda)’

6.5.15 Simplified Multi-Block Views
-----------------------------------

Creating multi-block views usually requires verbose ‘blocks’ syntax.
The View DSL offers a simpler alternative: just list the types you want
to see.

   *For:* Users who want quick multi-block views without boilerplate.

   • The Problem: Verbose Block Definitions

     A typical area-of-focus review view requires this:

          ;; Verbose: every block needs explicit configuration
          '((name . "Health Review")
            (blocks . (((name . "Projects")
                        (type . project)
                        (area-of-focus . "Health"))
                       ((name . "Next Actions")
                        (type . next-action)
                        (area-of-focus . "Health"))
                       ((name . "Calendar")
                        (type . calendar)
                        (area-of-focus . "Health")
                        (when . today)))))

     Notice the repetition: ‘area-of-focus’ appears in every block, and
     you had to remember that ‘calendar’ needs ‘(when . today)’.

   • The Solution: Implicit Blocks

     The same view, simplified:

          ;; Concise: types expand automatically with smart defaults
          '((name . "Health Review")
            (area-of-focus . "Health")
            (type . project)
            (type . next-action)
            (type . calendar))

     When you list multiple ‘type’ keys at the top level, org-gtd
     automatically:
       1. Creates a block for each type
       2. Inherits top-level filters (‘area-of-focus’) to all blocks
       3. Applies smart defaults (e.g., ‘calendar’ gets ‘(when .
          today)’)

   • Try It Now

     Evaluate this (select and run ‘M-x eval-region’):

          (org-gtd-view-show
           '((name . "Quick Dashboard")
             (type . next-action)
             (type . delegated)
             (type . tickler)))

     You get three sections:
        • "Next Actions" - all your NEXT tasks
        • "Delegated" - items due today (smart default: ‘when . today’)
        • "Tickler" - reminders due today (smart default: ‘when .
          today’)

     No ‘blocks’ syntax.  No ‘when’ filters.  org-gtd inferred them.

   • Smart Type Defaults

     Time-sensitive types automatically filter to "today":

     Type              Default ‘when’   Default Name
     ------------------------------------------------------------------
     ‘calendar’        ‘today’          "Calendar"
     ‘delegated’       ‘today’          "Delegated"
     ‘tickler’         ‘today’          "Tickler"
     ‘habit’           --               "Habits"
     ‘next-action’     --               "Next Actions"
     ‘project’         --               "Projects"
     ‘someday’         --               "Someday/Maybe"
     ‘stuck-project’   --               "Projects (Needs Attention)"

     *Why these defaults?*  For calendar, delegated, and tickler items,
     you usually want to see what's relevant _today_.  For other types,
     you want to see everything.

   • Top-Level Inheritance

     Filters at the top level apply to _all_ blocks:

          '((name . "Work Focus")
            (area-of-focus . "Work")  ;; Applied to all blocks
            (type . project)
            (type . next-action)
            (type . delegated))

     This shows only Work-related items across all three sections.

   • The Four-Tier Precedence Model

     When org-gtd expands implicit blocks, it applies settings in this
     order (highest priority first):

       1. *Block-explicit* -- If you use explicit ‘blocks’ syntax and
          set a value, it wins
       2. *Top-level* -- Filters at the view's top level inherit to all
          blocks
       3. *Type smart default* -- Built-in defaults for that type (e.g.,
          ‘calendar’ → ‘when . today’)
       4. *Global defaults* -- Package defaults like
          ‘org-gtd-prefix-width’

     *Example*: Override a smart default:

          ;; Show ALL calendar items, not just today
          '((name . "All Calendar")
            (when . future)  ;; Top-level overrides type default
            (type . calendar))

     *Example*: Mix explicit and implicit:

          '((name . "Mixed View")
            (area-of-focus . "Work")
            (type . next-action)  ;; Gets "Next Actions" name, Work filter
            (type . delegated))   ;; Gets "Delegated" name, Work filter, when=today

   • When to Use Explicit Blocks

     Use explicit ‘blocks’ syntax when you need:
        • Custom block names (implicit blocks use default names)
        • Different filters per block (beyond inheritance)
        • Non-standard block types like ‘calendar-day’ or ‘todo’

     *Example*: Custom names require explicit blocks:

          '((name . "My Dashboard")
            (blocks . (((name . "Today's Schedule")  ;; Custom name
                        (block-type . calendar-day))
                       ((name . "Ready to Work On")  ;; Custom name
                        (type . next-action)))))

6.6.1 What Are Organize Hooks?
------------------------------

Hooks let you automatically capture information about tasks as you
organize them—like tracking when tasks were created, auto-tagging items
with "urgent" in the title, or estimating effort based on keywords.

   Without hooks, you'd manually add the same metadata to every task.
With hooks, you define the pattern once and org-gtd applies it
automatically during organization.

   For anyone who wants consistent metadata on their GTD items without
repetitive manual work.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Your First Hook in 2 Minutes,  Next: The org-gtd-organize-hooks Variable,  Prev: What Are Organize Hooks?,  Up: Hooks Framework Reference

6.6.2 Your First Hook in 2 Minutes
----------------------------------

Let's add automatic creation timestamps to all tasks except trash and
quick actions.

  1. Add this to your config:
          (defun my-track-creation-date ()
            "Add CREATED property with current timestamp."
            (unless (org-gtd-organize-type-member-p '(trash quick-action))
              (org-set-property "CREATED"
                                (format-time-string "[%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M]"))))

          (add-to-list 'org-gtd-organize-hooks 'my-track-creation-date)

  2. Restart Emacs (or eval the code with ‘C-x C-e’)

  3. Capture something: ‘M-x org-gtd-capture’, type "Test task", finish
     capture

  4. Process it: ‘M-x org-gtd-process-inbox’, organize as "Single
     action"

  5. Look at the task: you'll see a CREATED property with today's
     timestamp

   You just automated metadata capture.  Every item you organize now
gets timestamped automatically.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: The org-gtd-organize-hooks Variable,  Next: Built-in Hooks,  Prev: Your First Hook in 2 Minutes,  Up: Hooks Framework Reference

6.6.3 The org-gtd-organize-hooks Variable
-----------------------------------------

*Type*: List of functions

   *When run*: During ‘org-gtd-organize’, after you choose item type but
before refiling

   *Purpose*: Add metadata (tags, properties, etc.)  to items as they're
organized

   *Default value*: ‘'(org-set-tags-command)’


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Built-in Hooks,  Next: Writing Custom Hooks,  Prev: The org-gtd-organize-hooks Variable,  Up: Hooks Framework Reference

6.6.4 Built-in Hooks
--------------------

   • ‘org-set-tags-command’

     *What it does*: Prompts for tags to add to the item

     *Use when*: You want to tag items during organization (default)

     *To use*:
          (setq org-gtd-organize-hooks '(org-set-tags-command))

   • ‘org-gtd-set-area-of-focus’

     *What it does*: Prompts for area of focus (from
     ‘org-gtd-areas-of-focus’) and sets CATEGORY property

     *Use when*: You use GTD Horizon 2 (areas of focus)

     *To use*:
          (setq org-gtd-organize-hooks '(org-set-tags-command
                                         org-gtd-set-area-of-focus))

     *Behavior*: Skips prompt for:
        • Project tasks (sets on project instead)
        • Trash items
        • Knowledge items
        • Quick actions


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Writing Custom Hooks,  Next: Example Custom Hooks,  Prev: Built-in Hooks,  Up: Hooks Framework Reference

6.6.5 Writing Custom Hooks
--------------------------

Custom hooks are functions that run during organization.  They can:
   • Add properties
   • Set tags
   • Modify heading text
   • Prompt for information
   • Skip certain item types

   • Basic Hook Structure

          (defun my-organize-hook ()
            "Description of what this hook does."
            (interactive)  ;; hooks can be interactive or not
            ;; Your code here
            ;; Point will be on the heading being organized
            ;; Use org-mode functions to modify it
            )

   • Using org-gtd-organize-type-member-p

     This helper function lets you run code only for specific item
     types.

     *Function signature*:
          (org-gtd-organize-type-member-p TYPE-LIST)

     *Arguments*:
     ‘TYPE-LIST’
          List of item type symbols to check against

     *Returns*: ‘t’ if current item matches one of the types, ‘nil’
     otherwise

     *Available types*:
     ‘'single-action’
          Single actions (do when possible)
     ‘'project-heading’
          Project headings (top-level project info)
     ‘'project-task’
          Tasks within projects
     ‘'calendar’
          Calendar items (do at a given time)
     ‘'delegated’
          Delegated items (done by someone else)
     ‘'tickler’
          Tickler items (remind me later - has a specific date)
     ‘'someday’
          Someday/maybe items (no specific timeframe)
     ‘'habit’
          Habits (recurring actions)
     ‘'knowledge’
          Reference items (stored as reference)
     ‘'quick-action’
          Quick actions (<2 min)
     ‘'trash’
          Trashed items
     ‘'everything’
          Special value: if in the list, always return t

     *Example*: Only run for single actions and project headings:
          (defun my-hook ()
            (when (org-gtd-organize-type-member-p '(single-action project-heading))
              ;; do something
              ))


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Example Custom Hooks,  Next: Hook Execution Order,  Prev: Writing Custom Hooks,  Up: Hooks Framework Reference

6.6.6 Example Custom Hooks
--------------------------

   • Selective Tagging with Unless

     The most common pattern is "run this hook for everything EXCEPT
     certain types".  This example prompts for tags on all items except
     trash and knowledge (reference):

          (defun my-tag-tasks ()
            "Prompt for tags on all items except trash and knowledge."
            (unless (org-gtd-organize-type-member-p '(trash knowledge))
              (org-set-tags-command)))

          (setq org-gtd-organize-hooks '(my-tag-tasks))

     This replaces the default ‘org-set-tags-command’ with selective
     tagging.  The ‘unless’ pattern is cleaner than listing all the
     types you DO want: it says "skip these few, run for everything
     else."

   • Add Effort Estimation

          (defun my-add-effort ()
            "Prompt for effort estimation when organizing single actions and projects."
            (when (org-gtd-organize-type-member-p '(single-action project-heading))
              (call-interactively #'org-set-effort)))

          (add-to-list 'org-gtd-organize-hooks 'my-add-effort)

   • Add Priority

          (defun my-add-priority ()
            "Prompt for priority when organizing single actions."
            (when (org-gtd-organize-type-member-p '(single-action))
              (call-interactively #'org-priority)))

          (add-to-list 'org-gtd-organize-hooks 'my-add-priority)

   • Auto-Set Property Based on Keywords

          (defun my-auto-tag-urgent ()
            "Automatically tag items with 'urgent' in their heading."
            (when (org-gtd-organize-type-member-p '(single-action project-heading))
              (let ((heading (org-get-heading t t t t)))
                (when (string-match-p (regexp-quote "URGENT") heading)
                  (org-set-tags ":urgent:")))))

          (add-to-list 'org-gtd-organize-hooks 'my-auto-tag-urgent)

   • Add Custom Property

          (defun my-add-client ()
            "Prompt for client name on work-related items."
            (when (org-gtd-organize-type-member-p '(single-action project-heading))
              (when (y-or-n-p "Is this for a client? ")
                (let ((client (read-string "Client name: ")))
                  (org-set-property "CLIENT" client)))))

          (add-to-list 'org-gtd-organize-hooks 'my-add-client)

   • Integration with Org-Roam

          (defun my-link-to-roam-project ()
            "Link GTD project to Org-Roam note."
            (when (org-gtd-organize-type-member-p '(project-heading))
              (when (y-or-n-p "Link to Org-Roam note? ")
                (org-roam-node-insert))))

          (add-to-list 'org-gtd-organize-hooks 'my-link-to-roam-project)

   • Set Effort from Keywords

          (defun my-auto-set-effort ()
            "Automatically set effort based on keywords in heading."
            (when (org-gtd-organize-type-member-p '(single-action))
              (let ((heading (downcase (org-get-heading t t t t))))
                (cond
                 ((string-match-p "quick\\|call\\|email" heading)
                  (org-set-property "Effort" "0:15"))
                 ((string-match-p "meeting\\|review" heading)
                  (org-set-property "Effort" "1:00"))
                 ((string-match-p "research\\|write\\|design" heading)
                  (org-set-property "Effort" "2:00"))))))

          (add-to-list 'org-gtd-organize-hooks 'my-auto-set-effort)


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Hook Execution Order,  Next: Best Practices,  Prev: Example Custom Hooks,  Up: Hooks Framework Reference

6.6.7 Hook Execution Order
--------------------------

Hooks run in the order they appear in ‘org-gtd-organize-hooks’.

   *Example*: Set area first, then tags:
     (setq org-gtd-organize-hooks
           '(org-gtd-set-area-of-focus  ;; runs first
             org-set-tags-command))      ;; runs second

   This order matters if one hook depends on another's results.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Best Practices,  Next: Complete Example Comprehensive Hook Setup,  Prev: Hook Execution Order,  Up: Hooks Framework Reference

6.6.8 Best Practices
--------------------

  1. *Use type checking*: Always use ‘org-gtd-organize-type-member-p’ to
     run hooks only for relevant item types

  2. *Keep hooks focused*: Each hook should do one thing well

  3. *Make hooks optional*: Use ‘y-or-n-p’ for optional metadata:
          (when (y-or-n-p "Add custom property? ")
            (org-set-property "PROP" value))

  4. *Test interactively*: Make hooks interactive for testing:
          (defun my-hook ()
            (interactive)  ;; can test with M-x my-hook
            ...)

  5. *Handle errors gracefully*: Wrap risky code in condition-case:
          (condition-case err
              (my-risky-operation)
            (error (message "Hook failed: %s" err)))

  6. *Document your hooks*: Add docstrings explaining what each hook
     does

             my-auto-tag-contexts        ;; suggest context tags
             my-add-effort               ;; estimate effort
             my-add-priority             ;; set priority if needed
             my-track-creation-date))    ;; track when created

   This creates a comprehensive metadata capture workflow during
organization.

8.1 Finding lost tasks
======================

Sometimes items get stuck or fall through the cracks.  org-gtd provides
several commands to find problematic items:

‘org-gtd-reflect-stuck-calendar-items’
     Calendar items with invalid or missing timestamps
‘org-gtd-reflect-stuck-tickler-items’
     Tickler items with invalid or missing review dates
‘org-gtd-reflect-stuck-habit-items’
     Habits with incorrect configuration
‘org-gtd-reflect-stuck-delegated-items’
     Delegated items missing delegate or date information
‘org-gtd-reflect-stuck-single-action-items’
     Single actions that aren't marked as NEXT
‘org-gtd-reflect-stuck-projects’
     Projects that have tasks but no NEXT actions
‘org-gtd-reflect-missed-items’
     Items that should have been processed but weren't

   See *note Commands Reference:: for detailed documentation of these
commands.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Projects without a NEXT item,  Next: I can't create a project when clarifying an inbox item!,  Prev: Finding lost tasks,  Up: Troubleshooting

8.2 Projects without a NEXT item
================================

If a project has active tasks but none are marked NEXT, this usually
indicates:
  1. Missing dependency configuration (no ‘ORG_GTD_FIRST_TASKS’
     property)
  2. org-edna is not enabled
  3. Dependency properties need recalculation
  4. Task states are inconsistent after external edits (mobile apps,
     sync conflicts)

   *Solution for one project*: Put the point on the project heading and
run ‘M-x org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords-for-project-at-point’.

   *Solution for all projects*: Run ‘M-x
org-gtd-projects-fix-all-todo-keywords’ to fix all projects at once.
This is especially useful after:
   • Editing tasks on mobile apps or web interfaces
   • Resolving sync conflicts
   • Bulk manual edits outside org-gtd
   • Migrating or importing data

   *Note*: Make sure org-edna is enabled: ‘(org-edna-mode 1)’ in your
init file.  See *note Configuring:: for setup instructions.

   See also: *note Working with Projects (Advanced):: for complete
project troubleshooting guide.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: I can't create a project when clarifying an inbox item!,  Next: Configuration problems,  Prev: Projects without a NEXT item,  Up: Troubleshooting

8.3 I can't create a project when clarifying an inbox item!
===========================================================

When organizing an item as a project, org-gtd expects a specific
structure:

     * Project heading
     ** First task
     ** Second task
     ** Third task

   *Common issues*:
   • Top-level heading must be a single asterisk ‘*’
   • Tasks must be second-level headings ‘**’
   • Must have at least one task under the project heading

   See *note data shape requirements:: for complete details.

   If this doesn't solve your problem, please open an issue at
<https://github.com/Trevoke/org-gtd.el/issues> with:
  1. The exact structure of your item in the clarify buffer
  2. What happens when you try to organize it
  3. Any error messages

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Keywords not working,  Next: Items not showing in engage view,  Up: Configuration problems

8.4.1 Keywords not working
--------------------------

If TODO keywords aren't changing correctly:

  1. *Check ‘org-todo-keywords’ includes all GTD keywords in one
     sequence*:
          (setq org-todo-keywords
                '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))

  2. *Check ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’ maps to those keywords*:
          (setq org-gtd-keyword-mapping
                '((todo . "TODO")
                  (next . "NEXT")
                  (wait . "WAIT")
                  (done . "DONE")
                  (canceled . "CNCL")))

  3. *Remove any ‘#+TODO:’ lines from GTD org files*

   See *note Configuring:: for complete setup instructions.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Items not showing in engage view,  Prev: Keywords not working,  Up: Configuration problems

8.4.2 Items not showing in engage view
--------------------------------------

If items aren't appearing in ‘org-gtd-engage’:

  1. *Check org-agenda-files includes org-gtd-directory*:
          ;; Must be set after org-gtd loads
          (with-eval-after-load 'org-gtd
            (setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory)))
     For ‘use-package’, put this in the ‘:config’ section.

  2. *Check item has correct properties*:
        • Single actions should have ‘ORG_GTD: Actions’ and TODO keyword
          NEXT
        • Project tasks should have ‘ORG_GTD: Actions’ and be part of a

8.5 Tasks still showing after tickler'ing project
=================================================

*Symptom*: Tickler'd a project but some tasks still appear in engage
view.

   *Diagnosis*:
   • Multi-project tasks (tasks shared between projects) are not
     tickler'd
   • If task belongs to Project A and Project B, and you only tickler
     Project A, the task stays visible

   *Solution*:
   • Check task's ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS property to see which projects it
     belongs to
   • Either tickler all projects the task belongs to, or remove it from
     one project first
   • During tickler, watch for "Skipping multi-project task" messages

   *Recommended workflow*:
  1. Before tickler'ing: review the project for multi-project tasks
  2. Decide: should this task stay active (part of other project) or be
     tickler'd too?
  3. If tickler'ing: tickler all projects it belongs to
  4. If staying active: accept that it will remain visible
