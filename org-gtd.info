1 Summary
*********

This package tries to replicate as closely as possible the GTD workflow
(see diagram below).

   This package, and this documentation, assume familiarity with the
flow of GTD as described in the book.

   This package provides a system that allows you to capture incoming
things into an inbox, then process the inbox and categorize each item
based on the GTD categories.  It leverages org-agenda to show today's
items as well as the NEXT items.  It provides a flexible project
management system with support for both sequential and parallel task
execution.

Version 4.0 is a major release that transforms how Org GTD handles
projects and configuration, while maintaining compatibility with your
existing GTD data.

* Menu:

* Flexible project dependencies (the big one!)::
* Simplified keyword configuration::

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Flexible project dependencies (the big one!),  Next: Simplified keyword configuration,  Up: What's new in 40

2.1 Flexible project dependencies (the big one!)
================================================

Projects are no longer limited to sequential tasks!  You can now create
complex project structures with parallel tasks and custom dependencies.

   • *Define any dependency relationship* - Tasks can block other tasks,
     creating a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of dependencies
   • *Parallel work streams* - Multiple tasks can be NEXT at the same
     time if they don't depend on each other
   • *Automatic dependency detection* - Org GTD finds all tasks that are
     ready to work on based on the dependency graph
   • *Cycle prevention* - The system prevents circular dependencies that
     would create deadlocks
   • *Visual dependency helper* (optional) - See task relationships in a
     side window while clarifying projects

   Tasks without explicit dependencies still work sequentially (as
before), so your existing projects continue to work unchanged.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Simplified keyword configuration,  Next: Data-driven configuration,  Prev: Flexible project dependencies (the big one!),  Up: What's new in 40

2.2 Simplified keyword configuration
====================================

The new keyword configuration system is clearer and more maintainable:

   • *One mapping instead of many variables* - Replace individual
     keyword variables (‘org-gtd-next’, ‘org-gtd-todo’, etc.)  with a
     single ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’ structure
   • *Global TODO keywords* - No more file-level ‘#+TODO:’ lines that
     can conflict.  Use Emacs' global ‘org-todo-keywords’ configuration
     instead
   • *Automatic validation* - Org GTD validates your keyword
     configuration and provides helpful error messages if something is
     wrong
   • *Better Emacs 29+ support* - Use ‘setopt’ for automatic validation
     when setting variables

   See *note Configuration options: Tell me all the levers I can pull.
for details.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Data-driven configuration,  Next: Declarative view language,  Prev: Simplified keyword configuration,  Up: What's new in 40

2.3 Data-driven configuration
=============================

New configuration system allows you to customize item properties
declaratively:

   • *Configure by item type* - Define what properties each GTD item
     type should have
   • *Prompt for user input* - Automatically prompt for dates, text, or
     custom data when organizing
   • *Extensible* - Easy to add your own custom configuration for new
     item types


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Declarative view language,  Next: Better project modification,  Prev: Data-driven configuration,  Up: What's new in 40

2.4 Declarative view language
=============================

Creating custom agenda views is now much easier with a declarative
syntax:

   • *Specify what you want, not how to get it* - Define views using
     simple filters instead of complex skip functions
   • *Built on org-ql* - Leverages the powerful org-ql query language
     for performance
   • *More maintainable* - View definitions are data structures, not
     code


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Better project modification,  Next: Enhanced review capabilities,  Prev: Declarative view language,  Up: What's new in 40

2.5 Better project modification
===============================

   • *Add tasks to projects anywhere* - You can now add tasks to
     projects even if the project file is outside ‘org-gtd-directory’
   • *Modify project structure* - Commands to create task dependencies
     and manage complex projects


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Enhanced review capabilities,  Next: Simplified configuration,  Prev: Better project modification,  Up: What's new in 40

2.6 Enhanced review capabilities
================================

   • *Find missed items* - New ‘org-gtd-review-missed-items’ command to
     catch things that slipped through
   • *Better stuck project detection* - Improved identification of
     projects that need attention


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Simplified configuration,  Next: What you need to do,  Prev: Enhanced review capabilities,  Up: What's new in 40

2.7 Simplified configuration
============================

   • *org-gtd-mode is obsolete* - No need for a special mode anymore.
     Just configure ‘org-agenda-files’ and ‘org-edna’ directly in your
     init file.  The old mode was wrapping all agenda commands
     unnecessarily and had org-edna configured incorrectly.

2.8 What you need to do
=======================

If you're upgrading from 3.x, see the *note Upgrading section:
Upgrading. for complete step-by-step instructions.  The required changes
are:

  1. Update your keyword configuration to use ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’
  2. Remove any ‘#+TODO:’ lines from your GTD files
  3. *Run the migration: ‘M-x org-gtd-upgrade-v3-to-v4’* (required for
     projects to work!)

   For new installations, just configure ‘org-todo-keywords’ and
‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’ and you're ready to go.

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: 400 <- 3xx,  Up: Upgrading

3.1.1 4.0.0 <- 3.x.x
--------------------

Version 4.0 introduces major improvements to keyword configuration and
project management.  Your existing GTD data will continue to work, but
you'll need to update your configuration and optionally migrate to take
full advantage of new features.

   • Required: Configuration changes

     **1.  Update keyword configuration**

     **OLD way (version 3.x):**
          ;; Individual keyword variables (no longer used)
          (setq org-gtd-next "NEXT")
          (setq org-gtd-todo "TODO")
          (setq org-gtd-wait "WAIT")
          (setq org-gtd-canceled "CNCL")

     **NEW way (version 4.0):**
          ;; First, configure org-mode's global TODO keywords
          ;; All your GTD keywords must be in the same sequence
          (setq org-todo-keywords
                '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))

          ;; Then map GTD semantic states to your keywords
          ;; Use setopt (Emacs 29+) for automatic validation, or setq for older versions
          (setopt org-gtd-keyword-mapping
                  '((todo . "TODO")      ;; tasks not ready to be acted upon
                    (next . "NEXT")      ;; tasks ready to act on immediately
                    (wait . "WAIT")      ;; tasks blocked or delegated
                    (canceled . "CNCL"))) ;; tasks that won't be completed

     Steps:
       1. Remove old keyword variables (‘org-gtd-next’, ‘org-gtd-todo’,
          ‘org-gtd-wait’, ‘org-gtd-canceled’ and their ‘-suffix’
          variants) from your configuration
       2. Remove any ‘#+TODO:’ lines from your GTD org files (inbox.org,
          org-gtd-tasks.org, etc.)
       3. Add the global keyword configuration to your Emacs init file
       4. Ensure all GTD keywords appear in the *same sequence* in
          ‘org-todo-keywords’

   • Required: Data migration

     Version 4.0 changes how projects work internally.  *The old
     TRIGGER-based system no longer functions* - v4 uses dependency
     properties instead.  You MUST run the migration for your existing
     projects to continue working.

     **Run the migration command:**

          M-x org-gtd-upgrade-v3-to-v4

     *Make a backup first!*  The migration modifies your GTD files.

     **What the migration does:**

     The migration performs two steps automatically:

       1. *Adds ORG_GTD properties* to identify items:
             • Adds ‘ORG_GTD="Projects"’ to project headings
             • Adds ‘ORG_GTD="Actions"’ to project tasks

       2. *Converts projects to dependency-based system*:
             • Adds ‘ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON’ and ‘ORG_GTD_BLOCKS’ properties
               to create sequential task chains
             • Adds ‘ORG_GTD_FIRST_TASKS’ property to project headings
             • Updates task states (NEXT/TODO) based on the new
               dependency graph

     **After migration:**

        • Your projects continue to work sequentially (task 1 → task 2 →
          task 3)
        • The sequential behavior is now implemented via dependency
          properties instead of TRIGGER
        • You can now customize dependencies for individual projects if
          you want parallel tasks
        • Safe to run multiple times if needed

   • Why these changes?

     **Keyword configuration:**
        • Simpler: One mapping structure instead of multiple variables
        • More reliable: Global configuration avoids file-level
          conflicts
        • Better validation: Org GTD checks your configuration and
          provides helpful errors
        • Future-proof: Easier to extend with new keyword types

     **Property-based system:**
        • More robust: Properties work reliably across different
          org-mode features
        • More flexible: Enables features like multi-project tasks
        • Better performance: Faster queries using org-ql

   • org-gtd-mode is obsolete

     The ‘org-gtd-mode’ minor mode is obsolete in version 4.0.  It
     previously wrapped all org-agenda commands with org-gtd context,
     but this is no longer necessary because:

       1. All org-gtd commands (like ‘org-gtd-engage’) already have the
          right context
       2. Users should configure ‘org-agenda-files’ directly
       3. Users should configure org-edna directly (the old mode had it
          configured incorrectly)

     If you were using ‘org-gtd-mode’, simply remove it and add these
     lines to your config:

          (setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))
          (org-edna-mode 1)

3.3.1 Basic setup
-----------------

You need to configure three things for org-gtd to work:

  1. *TODO keywords*: Configure ‘org-todo-keywords’ with your GTD
     workflow states
  2. *Keyword mapping*: Map GTD semantic states to your keywords with
     ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’
  3. *org-edna*: Enable org-edna with inheritance for project
     dependencies to work

   See the configuration sections below for details.

   Note: ‘org-gtd-mode’ is obsolete as of version 4.0.  Just configure
org-agenda-files and org-edna directly.

3.3.2 Complete Configuration Examples
-------------------------------------

*Configuration is the most critical part of setup.*  The examples below
are complete, working configurations you can copy-paste into your init
file.

   • Example 1: Vanilla Emacs (Minimal Configuration)

     This is the simplest possible configuration for org-gtd.  Copy this
     entire block into your init file:

          ;; Configure org-mode TODO keywords
          ;; All GTD keywords MUST be in the same sequence
          (setq org-todo-keywords
                '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))

          ;; Map GTD semantic states to your keywords
          (setq org-gtd-keyword-mapping
                '((todo . "TODO")      ; tasks not ready to act on
                  (next . "NEXT")      ; tasks ready to act on immediately
                  (wait . "WAIT")      ; tasks blocked or delegated
                  (canceled . "CNCL"))) ; tasks that won't be completed

          ;; Optional: Set GTD directory (defaults to ~/gtd/)
          ;; (setq org-gtd-directory "~/my-gtd/")

          ;; Add org-gtd files to your agenda
          (setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))

          ;; REQUIRED: Enable org-edna for project dependencies
          (org-edna-mode 1)

          ;; Global keybindings for GTD commands
          ;; These work anywhere in Emacs
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d c") 'org-gtd-capture)
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d e") 'org-gtd-engage)
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d p") 'org-gtd-process-inbox)
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d n") 'org-gtd-show-all-next)
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d s") 'org-gtd-review-stuck-projects)

          ;; Keybinding for clarify map
          ;; This only works when you're in a clarify buffer
          (with-eval-after-load 'org-gtd
            (define-key org-gtd-clarify-map (kbd "C-c c") 'org-gtd-organize))

   • Example 2: Doom Emacs Configuration

     If you use Doom Emacs, add this to your ‘packages.el’:

          (package! org-gtd)

     Then add this to your ‘config.el’:

          (use-package! org-gtd
            :after org
            :custom
            (org-gtd-directory "~/gtd/")
            (org-todo-keywords '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))
            (org-gtd-keyword-mapping '((todo . "TODO")
                                       (next . "NEXT")
                                       (wait . "WAIT")
                                       (canceled . "CNCL")))
            (org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))
            :config
            (org-edna-mode)
            ;; Doom-style leader key bindings
            (map! :leader
                  (:prefix ("d" . "org-gtd")
                   :desc "Capture"        "c"  #'org-gtd-capture
                   :desc "Engage"         "e"  #'org-gtd-engage
                   :desc "Process inbox"  "p"  #'org-gtd-process-inbox
                   :desc "Show all next"  "n"  #'org-gtd-show-all-next
                   :desc "Stuck projects" "s"  #'org-gtd-review-stuck-projects))
            ;; Clarify map binding
            (map! :map org-gtd-clarify-map
                  :desc "Organize this item" "C-c c" #'org-gtd-organize))

   • Example 3: Spacemacs Configuration

     If you use Spacemacs, add this to your ‘dotspacemacs/user-config’
     function:

          ;; Install org-gtd
          (use-package org-gtd
            :ensure t
            :after org
            :init
            ;; Configure org-mode TODO keywords
            (setq org-todo-keywords
                  '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))
            ;; Map GTD semantic states
            (setq org-gtd-keyword-mapping
                  '((todo . "TODO")
                    (next . "NEXT")
                    (wait . "WAIT")
                    (canceled . "CNCL")))
            ;; Optional: Set GTD directory
            (setq org-gtd-directory "~/gtd/")
            ;; Add to agenda files
            (setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))
            :config
            ;; REQUIRED: Enable org-edna for project dependencies
            (org-edna-mode 1)
            ;; Spacemacs leader key bindings
            (spacemacs/set-leader-keys
              "od c" 'org-gtd-capture
              "od e" 'org-gtd-engage
              "od p" 'org-gtd-process-inbox
              "od n" 'org-gtd-show-all-next
              "od s" 'org-gtd-review-stuck-projects)
            ;; Clarify map binding
            (with-eval-after-load 'org-gtd
              (define-key org-gtd-clarify-map (kbd "C-c c") 'org-gtd-organize)))

   • What These Configurations Do

     All three examples configure the same essential pieces:

       1. *‘org-todo-keywords’* - Defines the workflow states (TODO →
          NEXT → WAIT → DONE/CNCL)
             • The ‘|’ separator marks done states (right side) vs
               active states (left side)
             • All GTD keywords must be in a single sequence

       2. *‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’* - Maps GTD concepts to your
          keyword choices
             • ‘todo’ - Tasks not yet actionable
             • ‘next’ - Tasks ready to work on right now
             • ‘wait’ - Tasks blocked or delegated
             • ‘canceled’ - Tasks that won't be done

       3. *‘org-gtd-directory’* - Where org-gtd keeps its files
          (defaults to ‘~/gtd/’)

       4. *‘org-agenda-files’* - Makes org-gtd items appear in agenda
          views

       5. *‘org-edna-mode’* - REQUIRED for projects to work

       6. *Keybindings* - Two types:
             • *Global bindings*: Work anywhere in Emacs (capture,
               engage, process, etc.)
             • *Clarify map binding*: Only works when organizing items
               in clarify buffers

   • Testing Your Configuration

     After adding one of the configurations above and restarting Emacs,
     verify everything works:

     **Test 1: Capture works**

          M-x org-gtd-capture

     Expected: Opens a capture buffer for the inbox.

     If it fails: Check that ‘org-gtd-directory’ exists and you have
     write permissions.

     **Test 2: Engage works**

          M-x org-gtd-engage

     Expected: Opens an agenda view (might be empty if you haven't
     organized anything yet).

     If it fails: Check that ‘org-agenda-files’ includes your GTD
     directory.

     **Test 3: Keywords are recognized**

       1. Open any org file: ‘M-x find-file ~/test.org’
       2. Type: ‘* Test heading’
       3. Put cursor on the heading
       4. Try cycling TODO states: ‘C-c C-t’

     Expected: Should cycle through TODO → NEXT → WAIT → DONE → CNCL.

     If it fails: Check that ‘org-todo-keywords’ is set correctly.

     **Test 4: org-edna is enabled**

          M-x describe-variable RET org-edna-mode

     Expected: Should show "t" (enabled).

     If it fails: Make sure ‘(org-edna-mode 1)’ is in your config and
     you've restarted Emacs.

   • Common Configuration Problems

     Before troubleshooting, identify which configuration style you're
     using:
        • *Vanilla Emacs*: See *note Example 1 Vanilla Emacs: Example 1
          Vanilla Emacs (Minimal Configuration).
        • *Doom Emacs*: See *note Example 2 Doom Emacs: Example 2 Doom
          Emacs Configuration.
        • *Spacemacs*: See *note Example 3 Spacemacs: Example 3
          Spacemacs Configuration.

     Each example shows the complete, correct configuration for that
     environment.

     **Problem: "org-gtd-capture" is undefined**

     *Cause*: org-gtd package isn't installed or loaded.

     *Solution*:
        • *Vanilla Emacs*: Install from MELPA with ‘M-x package-install
          RET org-gtd RET’
        • *Doom Emacs*: Add ‘(package! org-gtd)’ to your ‘packages.el’
          and run ‘doom sync’
        • *Spacemacs*: The ‘use-package’ form in the *note Spacemacs
          example: Example 3 Spacemacs Configuration. automatically
          installs it with ‘:ensure t’

     **Problem: Keywords don't change when I press C-c C-t**

     *Cause*: ‘org-todo-keywords’ not configured correctly.

     *Solution*: Check your configuration has this setting:
          (setq org-todo-keywords
                '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))

     Common mistakes:
        • Keywords not in quotes: Should be ‘"TODO"’ not ‘TODO’
        • Missing sequence wrapper: Need ‘'((sequence ...))’ not just
          ‘'("TODO" ...)’
        • No done separator: Need ‘|’ before ‘"DONE"’ and ‘"CNCL"’

     See the complete configuration for your environment above.

     **Problem: Projects don't advance when I mark tasks DONE**

     *Cause*: org-edna isn't enabled.

     *Solution*: All three configuration examples include
     ‘(org-edna-mode 1)’.  Make sure you have:
        • *Vanilla/Spacemacs*: ‘(org-edna-mode 1)’ in the ‘:config’
          section
        • *Doom*: ‘(org-edna-mode)’ in the ‘:config’ section (Doom
          handles the argument)

     **Problem: Can't see GTD items in agenda**

     *Cause*: GTD directory not in ‘org-agenda-files’.

     *Solution*: All three configuration examples include this.  Check
     you have:
          (setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))

     Or if using ‘use-package’ / ‘use-package!’:
          :custom
          (org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))

     **Problem: Keybindings don't work**

     *Cause*: Keybindings not defined, or defined incorrectly for your
     environment.

     *Solution*:
        • *Vanilla Emacs*: Use ‘global-set-key’ for global commands,
          ‘define-key org-gtd-clarify-map’ for clarify buffer commands
        • *Doom Emacs*: Use ‘map!’ with ‘:leader’ prefix for global,
          ‘:map org-gtd-clarify-map’ for clarify buffer
        • *Spacemacs*: Use ‘spacemacs/set-leader-keys’ for global,
          ‘define-key’ for clarify buffer

     The clarify binding (‘C-c c’) *only works in clarify buffers* - you
     must run ‘M-x org-gtd-process-inbox’ first.

     See the complete configuration for your environment to copy the
     correct keybinding syntax.

3.3.3 Understanding Keybindings
-------------------------------

org-gtd uses two types of keybindings, and understanding the difference
is important:

   • Global Keybindings

     These work *anywhere* in Emacs and let you access the main GTD
     commands:

          ;; These commands are always available:
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d c") 'org-gtd-capture)       ; Capture to inbox
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d e") 'org-gtd-engage)        ; Daily view
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d p") 'org-gtd-process-inbox) ; Process inbox
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d n") 'org-gtd-show-all-next) ; Show NEXT actions

     You can use any key combination you prefer.  The ‘C-c d’ prefix is
     just a convention.

   • Clarify Map Keybindings

     These only work when you're in a *clarify buffer* (during inbox
     processing).  The most important one is:

          ;; This only works in clarify buffers:
          (define-key org-gtd-clarify-map (kbd "C-c c") 'org-gtd-organize)

     **When you're in a clarify buffer:**
       1. You've called ‘org-gtd-process-inbox’ and are looking at an
          item
       2. You've edited the item to make it clear and actionable
       3. Now you press ‘C-c c’ to organize it (choose its type:
          project, single action, etc.)

     **Why the distinction?**

     The clarify map is a separate keymap because:
        • It prevents conflicts with other org-mode bindings
        • It only activates when you need it (during processing)
        • You can bind different keys for organizing without affecting
          the rest of Emacs

     **Common patterns:**

     Most users bind:
        • ‘C-c d *’ for global commands (capture, engage, process)
        • ‘C-c c’ for organizing (only in clarify buffers)

     But you can use whatever works for your workflow!


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Required configuration of sub-packages,  Next: configuration options for org-gtd,  Prev: Understanding Keybindings,  Up: Configuring

3.3.4 Required configuration of sub-packages
--------------------------------------------

   • Configuring org-edna

     package: <https://www.nongnu.org/org-edna-el/>

     This configuration is *REQUIRED* for project dependencies to work
     correctly.  It enables org-edna to automatically update task states
     when you complete tasks in a project.

          (org-edna-mode 1)

   • Adding org-gtd files to your agenda

     To see org-gtd items in your agenda views, add the org-gtd
     directory to your ‘org-agenda-files’:

          ;; If you only want GTD files in your agenda:
          (setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))

          ;; Or if you have other agenda files, add GTD to the list:
          (add-to-list 'org-agenda-files org-gtd-directory)


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: configuration options for org-gtd,  Next: Recommended key bindings,  Prev: Required configuration of sub-packages,  Up: Configuring

3.3.5 configuration options for org-gtd
---------------------------------------

   • I don't care, just let me start using it

     The most direct way to find out about the configuration options for
     org-gtd is to see the customize group: ‘M-x customize-group RET
     org-gtd’.  They are all optional because they all come with default
     values.

     The only one you may want to change before starting to use Org GTD
     is ‘org-gtd-directory’, which is the directory that Org GTD will
     look to for everything it needs to do.

     The configuration options will also be mentioned in the relevant
     subsections of *note Using Org GTD::.

   • Tell me all the levers I can pull

     Make sure you also read about sub-package configuration: *note
     Required configuration of sub-packages::.

        • Required keyword configuration

          These settings are *required* for Org GTD to work properly:

          ‘org-todo-keywords’
               (‘org-mode’ variable) Define your TODO keyword sequences
               here.  All GTD keywords (TODO, NEXT, WAIT, DONE, CNCL or
               your custom versions) *must* be in the same sequence.
               Example.
                    (setq org-todo-keywords
                          '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))

          ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’
               Map GTD semantic states to your chosen keywords.  This
               tells Org GTD which keyword means what.  The four
               required mappings are.
               ‘todo’
                    Tasks not ready to be acted upon
               ‘next’
                    Tasks ready to act on immediately
               ‘wait’
                    Tasks blocked or delegated to someone else
               ‘canceled’
                    Tasks that won't be completed

               Example configuration (use ‘setopt’ for Emacs 29+ to get
               automatic validation):
                    (setopt org-gtd-keyword-mapping
                            '((todo . "TODO")
                              (next . "NEXT")
                              (wait . "WAIT")
                              (canceled . "CNCL")))

               Or for older Emacs versions:
                    (setq org-gtd-keyword-mapping
                          '((todo . "TODO")
                            (next . "NEXT")
                            (wait . "WAIT")
                            (canceled . "CNCL")))

        • Optional configuration

          ‘org-gtd-directory’
               set this to a directory.  ‘org-gtd’ will look for all its
               files in this directory.
          ‘org-gtd-capture-templates’
               (!note: take care when changing this) This defines the
               pre-filled text that will show up when capturing an item
               to the inbox.  The only requirements are that the
               template string must define an org-mode top-level
               heading, and that the entry point to the inbox.  That is
               to say, the first two characters must be a single
               asterisk followed by a space: ‘"* "’, and the entry type
               must be like this: ‘entry (file ,#'org-gtd-inbox-path)’.
               *note Adding things to the inbox::.
          ‘org-reverse-note-order’
               (‘org-mode’ variable) set this to ‘t’ to add new items to
               the top of project tasks and to ‘nil’ to add new items to
               the bottom of project tasks when organizing an item as
               such.
          ‘org-gtd-organize-hooks’
               this is a list of functions that you can use to decorate
               each item when you clarify it.  For instance, you could
               add a function to set the effort, or the priority, or
               some category, etc.  By default it has only one function,
               which lets you add tags, but of course you can change
               this entirely.  *note Organizing an item: Organizing an
               item into the system.
          ‘org-gtd-archive-location’
               Points to a function to generate the archive file
               dynamically.  Default value generates a file suffixed
               with the current year.  The function has an arity of zero
               and generates an org-mode file+outline path.  *note
               Cleaning up / archiving completed work::.
          ‘org-gtd-refile-to-any-target’
               when ‘t’, ‘org-gtd’ will refile to the first target it
               finds, and create a target if it doesn't find one.  When
               false, it will ask for confirmation before refiling.
               *note Refiling to the appropriate area::.
          ‘org-gtd-delegate-read-func’
               function that is used to prompt for a person a task is
               delegated to.  Must return a string.  By default this is
               set to ‘read-string’.
          ‘org-gtd-areas-of-focus’
               list of strings representing your areas of focus (horizon
               2 in GTD).
          ‘org-gtd-clarify-show-horizons’
               When clarifying, do you want the horizons buffer to be
               shown by default, or do you prefer it hidden?
          ‘org-gtd-clarify-project-templates’
               Alist of strings: ‘project template name . project
               template’ where there template is a series of tasks you
               may want to insert automatically, if you have a generic
               type of project that comes up a lot.
          ‘org-gtd-horizons-file’
               Name of the file, in ‘org-gtd-directory’, that will be
               displayed when the horizons buffer is displayed when
               clarifying.
          ‘org-gtd-engage-prefix-width’
               how many characters to dedicate to the prefix, on the
               left side of the TODO items, so the project name, if any,
               can show clearly.

3.3.6 Recommended key bindings
------------------------------

There's an important keymap you'll want to make the flow of processing
the inbox smoother.  To limit impact on your emacs configuration, there
is a specific keymap you can use.  The function you'll want to bind is
‘org-gtd-organize’.  I suggest ‘C-c c’, as in the following example.

     (define-key org-gtd-clarify-map (kbd "C-c c") #'org-gtd-organize)

   For other keybindings, do what you need.  My bindings use ‘C-c d’ as
a prefix, i.e.:

‘C-c d c’
     ‘org-gtd-capture’
‘C-c d e’
     ‘org-gtd-engage’

   etc.

4.1 Quick Start Reference
=========================

If you haven't done the 5-minute Quick Start in the README yet, do that
first.  It walks you through:
  1. Capturing a single action
  2. Processing your inbox
  3. Organizing the item
  4. Seeing it in your engage view

   That Quick Start proves the basic cycle works.  Now let's see what
makes org-gtd special: automatic project management and custom views.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Tutorial Your First Project,  Next: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View,  Prev: Quick Start Reference,  Up: Getting Started with Org GTD

4.2 Tutorial: Your First Project
================================

You've captured and organized a single action.  That's great for simple
tasks, but GTD's real power is managing multi-step projects.  Let's
create one and watch org-gtd handle the complexity automatically.

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: What You'll Learn,  Next: The Project,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.1 What You'll Learn
-----------------------

   • How to capture and structure a project
   • How org-gtd automatically manages task dependencies
   • How tasks advance from TODO → NEXT when dependencies are satisfied
   • How the engage view shows you what's immediately actionable


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: The Project,  Next: Step 1 Capture the Project,  Prev: What You'll Learn,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.2 The Project
-----------------

We'll plan a small house renovation with three sequential steps:
  1. Review blueprints
  2. Order windows
  3. Schedule carpenter

   This demonstrates sequential project execution - the default behavior
where each task must complete before the next begins.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Step 1 Capture the Project,  Next: Step 2 Process the Inbox,  Prev: The Project,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.3 Step 1: Capture the Project
---------------------------------

Press ‘C-c d c’ (or ‘M-x org-gtd-capture’).

   Type (or paste) this structure:

     * House Renovation
     ** Review blueprints
     ** Order windows of the right size
     ** Schedule carpenter

   *Important*: Projects in org-gtd have a specific structure:
   • Top-level heading (‘*’) is the project name
   • Second-level headings (‘**’) are the tasks

   Press ‘C-c C-c’ to save.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Step 2 Process the Inbox,  Next: Step 3 Organize as a Project,  Prev: Step 1 Capture the Project,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.4 Step 2: Process the Inbox
-------------------------------

Press ‘C-c d p’ (or ‘M-x org-gtd-process-inbox’).

   You'll see your project in a clarify buffer.  This is your chance to
refine it:
   • Add details to tasks (we already added "of the right size" to
     clarify what we need)
   • Fix typos
   • Make everything crystal clear

   When you're satisfied, press ‘C-c c’ to organize.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Step 3 Organize as a Project,  Next: Step 4 View in Engage,  Prev: Step 2 Process the Inbox,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.5 Step 3: Organize as a Project
-----------------------------------

The transient menu appears with organization options.  Press *[p]* for
"Project".

   Watch what org-gtd does automatically:
  1. Marks the first task ("Review blueprints") as *NEXT*
  2. Marks other tasks as *TODO*
  3. Sets up dependency relationships (task 1 blocks task 2, task 2
     blocks task 3)
  4. Refiles the entire project to your projects file

   You'll see a prompt for tags (optional).  Press ‘RET’ to skip or add
tags if you want.

   The project is now in your GTD system!


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Step 4 View in Engage,  Next: Step 5 Complete the First Task,  Prev: Step 3 Organize as a Project,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.6 Step 4: View in Engage
----------------------------

Press ‘C-c d e’ (or ‘M-x org-gtd-engage’).

   You'll see an agenda view showing:
   • *NEXT: Review blueprints* - This is immediately actionable
   • The project "House Renovation" appears in the list
   • Other tasks ("Order windows", "Schedule carpenter") don't show as
     NEXT - they're waiting for the first task

   This is your daily engagement view - it shows *only* what you can act
on right now, not everything in your system.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Step 5 Complete the First Task,  Next: Step 6 Refresh and See the Change,  Prev: Step 4 View in Engage,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.7 Step 5: Complete the First Task
-------------------------------------

In the agenda view, move your cursor to "Review blueprints".

   Press *t* to cycle the TODO state.

   Select *DONE*.

   *Magic happens*: Watch "Order windows of the right size"
automatically become NEXT!

   This is org-edna in action - the automatic dependency system org-gtd
uses.

4.2.8 Step 6: Refresh and See the Change
----------------------------------------

Press *g* to refresh the agenda view.

   You'll now see:
   • ✓ "Review blueprints" is DONE (depending on your agenda settings,
     it may be hidden)
   • *NEXT: Order windows of the right size* - Now actionable!
   • "Schedule carpenter" is still TODO - waiting for "Order windows" to
     complete


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: What Just Happened?,  Next: Continue the Project,  Prev: Step 6 Refresh and See the Change,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.9 What Just Happened?
-------------------------

Let's understand the automatic workflow:

  1. *When you organized as a project*, org-gtd:
        • Created a dependency chain: Task 1 → Task 2 → Task 3
        • Set properties (‘ORG_GTD_BLOCKS’, ‘ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON’) to
          track relationships
        • Marked only the first task as NEXT

  2. *When you marked "Review blueprints" DONE*, org-gtd:
        • Checked which tasks were blocked by this one
        • Found "Order windows" had no remaining blockers
        • Automatically changed it from TODO to NEXT

  3. *"Schedule carpenter" stays TODO* because:
        • It depends on "Order windows" completing
        • org-gtd won't mark it NEXT until its dependencies are
          satisfied

   You didn't manually manage any of this.  You just *did the work* and
marked tasks complete.  org-gtd handled the workflow automatically.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Continue the Project,  Next: Key Takeaways,  Prev: What Just Happened?,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.10 Continue the Project
---------------------------

Complete "Order windows" the same way:
  1. Go to the engage view (‘C-c d e’)
  2. Find "Order windows of the right size"
  3. When done, press *t* and select *DONE*
  4. Watch "Schedule carpenter" automatically become NEXT

   When all tasks are done, the project is complete.  You can archive it
with ‘M-x org-gtd-archive-completed-items’ during your weekly review.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Key Takeaways,  Next: What's Next?,  Prev: Continue the Project,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.11 Key Takeaways
--------------------

   • *Projects are multi-step actions* with automatic dependency
     management
   • *Sequential execution is the default* - tasks progress one after
     another
   • *The engage view shows only actionable items* - not everything in
     your system
   • *You focus on doing work, not managing workflows* - org-gtd handles
     task progression
   • *Completing tasks automatically advances projects* - no manual
     state management needed


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: What's Next?,  Prev: Key Takeaways,  Up: Tutorial Your First Project

4.2.12 What's Next?
-------------------

This was a sequential project (A → B → C). Later, you'll learn how to:
   • Create *parallel tasks* (A and B can both be NEXT simultaneously)
   • Set *custom dependencies* (A blocks C, B blocks C, but A and B are
     parallel)
   • Manage *complex project structures* with the dependency graph

   For now, practice with a few simple sequential projects.  The pattern
is always:
  1. *Capture* with project structure
  2. *Clarify* to make it clear
  3. *Organize* as a project
  4. *Engage* to see what's actionable
  5. *Complete* tasks and watch progression happen automatically

4.3 Tutorial: Creating Your First Custom View
=============================================

The built-in ‘org-gtd-engage’ view is powerful, but you'll want custom
views for different contexts.  org-gtd 4.0 has a declarative View DSL
that makes this easy.  Let's create a view that shows all your active
projects.

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: What You'll Learn (1),  Next: Why This View?,  Up: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View

4.3.1 What You'll Learn
-----------------------

   • How the View DSL works (declarative syntax)
   • How to create a simple custom view
   • How to call your view and see results
   • How to modify views for different needs


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Why This View?,  Next: Understanding the View DSL,  Prev: What You'll Learn (1),  Up: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View

4.3.2 Why This View?
--------------------

The engage view shows *today's actionable items* - what you should work
on right now.

   But sometimes you want the *big picture*:
   • What projects am I working on?
   • Which ones have active tasks?
   • What's the status of each project?

   This view answers those questions by showing all active projects at a
glance.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Understanding the View DSL,  Next: Creating the View Function,  Prev: Why This View?,  Up: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View

4.3.3 Understanding the View DSL
--------------------------------

Views in org-gtd are *declarative* - you describe *what* you want to
see, not *how* to find it.

   Here's the view we'll create:

     '((name . "My Active Projects")
       (filters . ((category . projects)
                   (has-active-tasks . t))))

   Let's break this down:

‘name’
     What displays in the view header
‘filters’
     What to include.
     ‘category . projects’
          Only show project headings (not single actions)
     ‘has-active-tasks . t’
          Only projects with work remaining

   That's it!  The View DSL translates this into an org-ql query and
shows results.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Creating the View Function,  Next: Using Your View,  Prev: Understanding the View DSL,  Up: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View

4.3.4 Creating the View Function
--------------------------------

Add this to your init file (after your org-gtd configuration):

     (with-eval-after-load 'org-gtd
       (defun my-org-gtd-active-projects ()
         "Show all active projects."
         (interactive)
         (org-gtd-view-show
          '((name . "My Active Projects")
            (filters . ((category . projects)
                        (has-active-tasks . t)))))))

   Save your init file and reload it (‘M-x eval-buffer’ or restart
Emacs).


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Using Your View,  Next: Binding to a Key,  Prev: Creating the View Function,  Up: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View

4.3.5 Using Your View
---------------------

Now you can call it:

     M-x my-org-gtd-active-projects

   You'll see a list of all your active projects!


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Binding to a Key,  Next: What You'll See,  Prev: Using Your View,  Up: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View

4.3.6 Binding to a Key
----------------------

For quick access, bind it to a key.  Add this to your configuration:

     ;; If using vanilla Emacs
     (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d P") 'my-org-gtd-active-projects)

     ;; If using Doom Emacs, add to your org-gtd config:
     (map! :leader
           (:prefix "d"
            :desc "Active projects" "P" #'my-org-gtd-active-projects))

     ;; If using Spacemacs, add to your config:
     (spacemacs/set-leader-keys "od P" 'my-org-gtd-active-projects)

   Now press ‘C-c d P’ (or your binding) to see active projects
instantly!


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: What You'll See,  Next: Experiment Modify the View,  Prev: Binding to a Key,  Up: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View

4.3.7 What You'll See
---------------------

The view shows:
   • All projects that have at least one active task
   • Each project's current state (what tasks are NEXT, TODO, etc.)
   • Project names and context

   Projects that are:
   • Completely DONE - Won't appear (no active tasks)
   • Canceled - Won't appear (no active tasks)
   • Have only TODO/NEXT/WAIT tasks - Will appear

4.3.8 Experiment: Modify the View
---------------------------------

Try these variations to see how the View DSL works:

   *Show ALL projects (including completed):*

     (defun my-org-gtd-all-projects ()
       "Show all projects, including completed ones."
       (interactive)
       (org-gtd-view-show
        '((name . "All Projects")
          (filters . ((category . projects))))))
          ;; Note: removed has-active-tasks filter

   *Show stuck projects:*

     (defun my-org-gtd-stuck-projects ()
       "Show projects that have work but no NEXT actions."
       (interactive)
       (org-gtd-view-show
        '((name . "Stuck Projects")
          (filters . ((category . projects)
                      (is-stuck . t))))))

   *Show projects in a specific area of focus* (if you use areas):

     (defun my-org-gtd-work-projects ()
       "Show only work projects."
       (interactive)
       (org-gtd-view-show
        '((name . "Work Projects")
          (filters . ((category . projects)
                      (has-active-tasks . t)
                      (area-of-focus . "Work"))))))


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Available Filters,  Next: Key Takeaways (1),  Prev: Experiment Modify the View,  Up: Tutorial Creating Your First Custom View

4.3.9 Available Filters
-----------------------

Here are common filters you can use in your views:

‘category’
     Filter by GTD category: ‘projects’, ‘actions’, ‘calendar’,
     ‘incubate’, ‘habits’
‘todo’
     Filter by keyword: ‘"NEXT"’, ‘"TODO"’, ‘"WAIT"’, ‘"DONE"’, ‘"CNCL"’
‘has-active-tasks’
     Only items with active (non-done) tasks
‘is-stuck’
     Projects that have tasks but no NEXT actions
‘scheduled’
     Items scheduled (you can specify ranges)
‘deadline’
     Items with deadlines
‘area-of-focus’
     Filter by area (if you use GTD horizons)
‘property’
     Filter by any org property

   You can combine multiple filters - they all must match (AND logic).

   • Use the engage view to see what's actionable
   • Create a few simple projects
   • Experiment with custom views

   The best way to learn GTD is to practice the workflow.  org-gtd
handles the complexity - you just do the work.

5.1 Your Daily Workflow
=======================

The GTD workflow has six steps.  You'll do the first four frequently
(even daily), and the last two periodically:

  1. *Capture* - Get things out of your head into your inbox
     (‘org-gtd-capture’)
  2. *Process* - Look at each inbox item one at a time
     (‘org-gtd-process-inbox’)
  3. *Clarify* - Edit the item to make it clear and actionable
  4. *Organize* - Categorize the item (‘org-gtd-organize’)
  5. *Engage* - Look at what you can do right now (‘org-gtd-engage’)
  6. *Review* - Periodically review your system for health

   You already practiced this in the *note Getting Started tutorials:
Getting Started with Org GTD. The sections below go deeper into each
part.

* Menu:

* Quick command reference::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Quick command reference,  Up: Your Daily Workflow

5.1.1 Quick command reference
-----------------------------

These are the commands you'll use most:

Command                             What it does             When to use it
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‘org-gtd-capture’                   Add item to inbox        Anytime something comes up
‘org-gtd-process-inbox’             Start processing inbox   Daily (or when inbox has items)
‘org-gtd-organize’                  Organize current item    During processing (in clarify buffer)
‘org-gtd-engage’                    See actionable items     Daily (your "work from" view)
‘org-gtd-show-all-next’             See only NEXT actions    When you want to focus on actions
‘org-gtd-review-stuck-projects’     Find stuck projects      Weekly review
‘org-gtd-archive-completed-items’   Archive finished items   Weekly/monthly cleanup

5.2 The GTD Flow in Depth
=========================

Here are the domain elements of GTD that we handle:

* Menu:

* Adding things to the inbox::
* Processing the inbox::
* Clarifying each item::
* Organizing an item into the system::
* Engaging with your GTD items::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Adding things to the inbox,  Next: Processing the inbox,  Up: The GTD Flow in Depth

5.2.1 Adding things to the inbox
--------------------------------

The trip through GTD arguably begins by adding things to the inbox.  The
inbox is a file called ‘inbox.org’ in the directory stored in the
variable ‘org-gtd-directory’.  By default this means the file will be
‘~/gtd/inbox.org’.

   Org GTD provides one function to capture items: ‘M-x
org-gtd-capture’.  In my setup I have this bound globally as such:

     (global-set-key "C-c d c" #'org-gtd-capture)

   This function uses the variable ‘org-gtd-capture-templates’ to define
org-gtd-specific capture templates.  By default it comes with two
templates, one to just capture a new item, and one to capture an item
with a link to the file where you were when you started the capture.

   You can customize these templates as you see fit.  In order to
maintain proper functioning of org-gtd, however, there are two
constraints:

  1. the first two characters of the template string must be a single
     asterisk followed by a space: ‘"* "’
  2. the entry type must be like this: ‘entry (file
     ,#'org-gtd-inbox-path)’

   *See also*: *note Configuration Variables Reference:: for complete
documentation of ‘org-gtd-capture-templates’ and ‘org-gtd-directory’.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Processing the inbox,  Next: Clarifying each item,  Prev: Adding things to the inbox,  Up: The GTD Flow in Depth

5.2.2 Processing the inbox
--------------------------

Processing the inbox means taking everything in the inbox, one at a
time, and refining/categorizing them so they are instantly useful when
you are looking at available next / scheduled actions.

   You can start processing the inbox with ‘org-gtd-process-inbox’.
This starts a looping behavior of clarifying each item in the inbox.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Clarifying each item,  Next: Organizing an item into the system,  Prev: Processing the inbox,  Up: The GTD Flow in Depth

5.2.3 Clarifying each item
--------------------------

Clarifying an item means editing and adding the information that will be
most valuable to you to the item.  Note that task-specific information,
such as appointment date, or name of person to whom it is delegated, or
even area of focus, will be added during the Organize step, so don't
worry about these yet.

   • How to start clarifying

     Besides ending up in here automatically while processing the inbox,
     there's two more ways to enter the clarifying flow:

     ‘org-gtd-clarify-item’
          call this from any org-mode heading to do a one-off
          clarification.
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-agenda-item’
          call this from the agenda view, if you have anything you want
          to re-clarify, or possibly clarify for the first time, from
          somewhere outside the inbox.

   • data shape requirements

     There's two general shapes you'll be looking for.  Almost
     everything will look like a simple org-mode heading.  For instance,
     ‘* Task desc’.

     The only exception will be a project, that will look like a
     top-level heading for the project description with, underneath, a
     series of second-level headings representing each task to be
     executed sequentially before the project is complete.

          * Project heading
          ** First task
          ** Second task
          ** Third task

   • Options and commands related to clarification

     The clarify buffers are ‘org-mode’ buffers that use the minor mode
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-mode’.  There is a keymap, ‘org-gtd-clarify-map’,
     that you can use to bind useful

     While clarifying, you may find it useful to see your GTD horizons.
     You can use:
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-toggle-horizons-window’
          a function that toggles the display of the horizons buffer
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-show-horizons’
          a boolean variable defining whether the horizons window should
          be shown (t) or hidden (nil) by default when clarifying an
          item.  See *note Working with the GTD Horizons:: for more
          details.

     If you are clarifying a project, you may be interested in project
     templates:
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-project-insert-template’
          a function that will ask you to choose a template to insert.
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-project-templates’
          an alist of the form ‘(name . template)’ where both name and
          template are strings.  ‘name’ will be used in the interactive
          menu, and ‘template’ will be inserted in the buffer.

     *See also*: *note Configuration Variables Reference:: for complete
     documentation of clarification options, and *note Commands
     Reference:: for all clarification commands.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Organizing an item into the system,  Next: Engaging with your GTD items,  Prev: Clarifying each item,  Up: The GTD Flow in Depth

5.2.4 Organizing an item into the system
----------------------------------------

When you are done clarifying, call ‘M-x org-gtd-organize’ (or hit your
keybinding for it, see *note Recommended key bindings::).  This will
open a transient menu to let you choose how Org GTD should categorize
this item.

   Organizing is broken up into three steps:
   • Choosing a task type (see *note Understanding GTD Item Types::)
   • Applying hooks to add additional relevant information (see *note
     Hooks Framework Reference::)
   • Refiling to the appropriate area (see *note Refiling: Refiling to
     the appropriate area. below)

   *See also*: *note Commands Reference:: for the ‘org-gtd-organize’
command and all organization-related commands.

   • Refiling to the appropriate area

     By default, org-gtd will refile to a single file in the directory,
     but you can create your own headings if you find it helpful.

     If you would like to add new refile targets, it's simple, follow
     these instructions.

        • New project heading

          Add a top-level heading in any ‘.org’ file (including a new
          one) in ‘org-gtd-directory’ and make sure its property drawer
          matches the one in the constant ‘org-gtd-projects-template’.

        • Other headings

          Create a new top-level heading in any ‘.org’ file (including a
          new one) in ‘org-gtd-directory’ and make sure its property
          drawer matches the one in the relevant template constant:

             • ‘org-gtd-habit-template’
             • ‘org-gtd-calendar-template’
             • ‘org-gtd-incubate-template’
             • ‘org-gtd-action-template’

          Here is an example:

               :PROPERTIES:
               :ORG_GTD: Action
               :END:


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Engaging with your GTD items,  Prev: Organizing an item into the system,  Up: The GTD Flow in Depth

5.2.5 Engaging with your GTD items
----------------------------------

You can see a list of all NEXT actions, and scheduled actions, with ‘M-x
org-gtd-engage’ .

   You can call ‘org-gtd-show-all-next’ to only see NEXT actions,
nothing scheduled.

   You can use ‘org-gtd-oops’ to see all the appointments you missed,
and act on them accordingly.

   The weekly review is not yet implemented.

5.3 Understanding GTD Item Types
================================

When you organize an item (‘org-gtd-organize’), a transient menu appears
with different item types.  This section explains what each type means
and when to use it.

   You already saw *Projects* and *Single actions* in the tutorials.
Here's the complete reference for all item types:

* Menu:

* Single Action [S]::
* Project [P]::
* Add to existing project [A]::
* Calendar [C]::
* Delegate [D]::
* Quick Action [Q]::
* Incubate [I]::
* Habit [H]::
* Knowledge [K]::
* Trash [T]::
* Working with the GTD Horizons::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Single Action [S],  Next: Project [P],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.1 Single Action [S]
-----------------------

*What it is*: A one-off task to do when you have time and energy.

   *When to use it*: For standalone tasks that aren't time-sensitive,
don't depend on anyone else, and can be done whenever you're ready.

   *Examples*:
   • Buy birthday gift for Alex
   • Read article about GTD methodology
   • Update profile photo
   • Clean garage

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Marks it as NEXT (immediately actionable)
   • Refiles to your actions file
   • Shows in ‘org-gtd-engage’ view


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Project [P],  Next: Add to existing project [A],  Prev: Single Action [S],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.2 Project [P]
-----------------

*What it is*: A multi-step action requiring more than one task to
complete.

   *When to use it*: When accomplishing your goal requires multiple
sequential (or parallel) steps.

   *Examples*:
   • House renovation (review blueprints → order materials → schedule
     work)
   • Launch product (design → build → test → deploy → announce)
   • Plan vacation (research destinations → book flights → arrange
     accommodation)

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Creates dependency relationships between tasks
   • Marks first task(s) as NEXT, others as TODO
   • Automatically advances tasks as you complete them
   • Refiles entire project to your projects file

   See *note Working with Projects: Working with Projects (Advanced).
for advanced features (parallel tasks, custom dependencies).


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Add to existing project [A],  Next: Calendar [C],  Prev: Project [P],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.3 Add to existing project [A]
---------------------------------

*What it is*: Add the current task to a project that already exists.

   *When to use it*: When you realize a project needs an additional
task, or you're breaking down a project task into sub-tasks.

   *Examples*:
   • Adding "Get permits" to your house renovation project
   • Adding "Write announcement email" to your product launch project

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Prompts you to choose which project
   • Inserts task into project (position depends on
     ‘org-reverse-note-order’)
   • Task keywords may need adjustment - use
     ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords-for-project-at-point’ on the
     project heading if needed


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Calendar [C],  Next: Delegate [D],  Prev: Add to existing project [A],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.4 Calendar [C]
------------------

*What it is*: An action that must be done at a specific date or time.

   *When to use it*: For appointments, events, or time-sensitive tasks.

   *Examples*:
   • Doctor appointment on Tuesday at 2pm
   • Team meeting every Monday at 9am
   • Submit report by Friday 5pm (deadline)
   • Call contractor on Thursday

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Prompts for date/time
   • Adds timestamp to ‘ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP’ property
   • Marks as NEXT
   • Shows in agenda views at the appropriate time

   *Note*: This is for calendar items, not scheduled work blocks.  In
GTD, scheduling means "do this at this time," not "start working on this
someday."


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Delegate [D],  Next: Quick Action [Q],  Prev: Calendar [C],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.5 Delegate [D]
------------------

*What it is*: A task someone else will do, but you need to follow up on.

   *When to use it*: When you're waiting for someone else to complete
something and you need to check back.

   *Examples*:
   • Waiting for designer to finish mockups
   • Asked colleague to review document
   • IT to fix laptop issue
   • Contractor to provide estimate

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Prompts for: person name, follow-up date
   • Sets ‘DELEGATED_TO’ property
   • Marks as WAIT
   • Shows in waiting-for views
   • Appears in agenda on follow-up date

   *Customization*: Set ‘org-gtd-delegate-read-func’ to use completion
for names.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Quick Action [Q],  Next: Incubate [I],  Prev: Delegate [D],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.6 Quick Action [Q]
----------------------

*What it is*: Tasks that take less than 2 minutes.

   *When to use it*: For trivial tasks you can do immediately.

   *Examples*:
   • Reply to quick email
   • File a document
   • Add item to shopping list
   • Send calendar invite

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Marks as DONE
   • Archives immediately
   • Assumes you just did it

   *GTD principle*: If it takes less than 2 minutes, do it now.  Don't
organize it - just do it and mark it done.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Incubate [I],  Next: Habit [H],  Prev: Quick Action [Q],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.7 Incubate [I]
------------------

*What it is*: Ideas or potential actions you're not ready to commit to
yet (someday/maybe).

   *When to use it*: For things you want to think about later but don't
want to act on now.

   *Examples*:
   • Learn Spanish (someday)
   • Write a book (maybe)
   • Remodel kitchen (not yet)
   • Take photography class (when I have time)

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Prompts for review date
   • Refiles to incubate file
   • Will remind you on that date to reconsider

   *GTD principle*: Keep these out of your active system.  Review
periodically (weekly/monthly) to decide if they're ready to become real
projects or actions.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Habit [H],  Next: Knowledge [K],  Prev: Incubate [I],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.8 Habit [H]
---------------

*What it is*: Recurring tasks you want to track consistently (org-mode
habits).

   *When to use it*: For building routines and tracking streaks.

   *Examples*:
   • Exercise daily
   • Write in journal
   • Review finances weekly
   • Call parents monthly

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Prompts for: repeat pattern (e.g., "daily", "+1w"), start date
   • Creates org-mode habit with consistency tracking
   • Shows habit graph in agenda views

   *Note*: See org-mode documentation for habit repeat patterns and
tracking.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Knowledge [K],  Next: Trash [T],  Prev: Habit [H],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.9 Knowledge [K]
-------------------

*What it is*: Reference information to store for later.

   *When to use it*: When the item is information to keep, not an action
to take.

   *Examples*:
   • Recipe you want to remember
   • Quote from article
   • Meeting notes for reference
   • Product specifications

   *Important*: Choose this AFTER you've properly stored the information
somewhere (your notes system, wiki, etc.).  This just marks the inbox
item as "filed" and archives it.

   *GTD principle*: Separate "stuff to do" from "stuff to know."
Knowledge goes in your reference system, not your action lists.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Trash [T],  Next: Working with the GTD Horizons,  Prev: Knowledge [K],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.10 Trash [T]
----------------

*What it is*: Not actionable, not worth keeping.

   *When to use it*: When you captured something that turns out to be
irrelevant, already done, or not worth pursuing.

   *Examples*:
   • Event that already passed
   • Duplicate of another item
   • Idea that's no longer relevant
   • Spam/noise

   *What org-gtd does*:
   • Deletes the item
   • Doesn't archive, just removes it

   *GTD principle*: Be ruthless.  If it's not actionable and not
valuable information, delete it.  Clutter in your system creates noise.

   *See also*: For technical details on how each item type is stored,
see *note Properties Reference::.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Working with the GTD Horizons,  Prev: Trash [T],  Up: Understanding GTD Item Types

5.3.11 Working with the GTD Horizons
------------------------------------

In GTD, the horizons are defined as such:

Ground
     the day-to-day
Horizon 1
     projects
Horizon 2
     areas of focus
Horizon 3
     1-2 year goals
Horizon 4
     3-5 year vision
Horizon 5
     purpose and principles

   Obviously, Ground and Horizons 1 are handled by the
"capture/clarify/organize/engage" flow we've already seen.

   GTD recommends that you do not start using the horizons above Horizon
1 until you have both Ground and Horizon 1 under control.  So, when you
are ready...

   • Areas of focus

     Horizon 2 is now handled by a variable and a hook you can add to
     ‘org-gtd-organize-hooks’:
        • ‘org-gtd-areas-of-focus’ is a list of strings, each
          representing one of your areas of focus.
        • ‘org-gtd-set-area-of-focus’ is the hook you would add, e.g.
          ‘(setq org-gtd-organize-hooks '(org-gtd-set-area-of-focus))’,
          it ensures each item you clarify will need to be part of a
          horizon.

     You can then use the function ‘org-gtd-review-area-of-focus’ to
     generate an agenda view to review a specific area of focus.

     In order to add areas of focus to pre-existing items in your
     system, without going through the clarifying flow, we provide two
     functions:
        • ‘org-gtd-area-of-focus-set-on-item-at-point’, when you are on
          a org heading
        • ‘org-gtd-area-of-focus-set-on-agenda-item’, when you are on an
          agenda item

     Do note that calling the function on item at point will trust you
     blindly to do the right thing, whereas setting the area of focus
     through the agenda will attempt to recognize if you are on a
     project task and thus set the category on the project itself
     instead of the task.

   • Longer-term horizons

     The longer-term horizons can be stored in a file in the
     ‘org-gtd-directory’.  A variable governs the name of the file,
     ‘org-gtd-horizons-file’, by default ‘horizons.org’.

     At the moment it does not seem particularly useful to add any
     automation around these, since they will change so infrequently.

     They are, however, useful to display.

     A variable, ‘org-gtd-clarify-show-horizons’, determines
     whether/where to display the side buffer while clarifying.

     Regardless of the value of this variable, you can use the function
     ‘org-gtd-clarify-toggle-horizons-window’ to display or hide the
     side window.  If the above variable is nil, then the horizons
     window will be toggled on the right side of the screen.

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Understanding Project Dependencies,  Next: Tutorial Project with Parallel Tasks,  Up: Working with Projects (Advanced)

5.4.1 Understanding Project Dependencies
----------------------------------------

Projects in org-gtd use a dependency graph to track task relationships.
Version 4.0 introduced flexible dependencies - you're not limited to
sequential execution anymore.

   • How dependencies work

     Task dependencies are managed through two org properties:

     ‘ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON’
          Contains IDs of tasks that must complete before this task can
          start (what blocks this task)
     ‘ORG_GTD_BLOCKS’
          Contains IDs of tasks that this task blocks (what depends on
          this task)
     ‘ORG_GTD_FIRST_TASKS’
          (On project heading) Contains IDs of tasks with no
          dependencies (the starting points)

   • Sequential vs Parallel

        • *Sequential* (default): Tasks execute one after another (A → B
          → C)
             • Only one task is NEXT at a time
             • Each task blocks the next
             • Great for workflows where order matters

        • *Parallel*: Multiple tasks can be NEXT simultaneously
             • Multiple independent work streams
             • Tasks with no dependencies start together
             • Faster project completion

        • *Mixed*: Some tasks parallel, others sequential
             • Most real projects use this
             • Example: Research and Planning happen in parallel, but
               both must finish before Building starts

   • The dependency graph (DAG)

     Tasks form a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):
        • *Directed*: Dependencies flow one way (A → B means B depends
          on A, not vice versa)
        • *Acyclic*: No circular dependencies (A → B → C → A is
          prevented)
        • *Graph*: Tasks can have multiple dependencies and block
          multiple tasks

     org-gtd automatically prevents circular dependencies to avoid
     deadlocks.

5.4.2 Tutorial: Project with Parallel Tasks
-------------------------------------------

Let's create a project where some tasks can happen simultaneously.

   • The Scenario

     You need to "Fix Shoulder Pain":
       1. Find MRI facility (research task)
       2. Make MRI appointment (depends on finding facility)
       3. Make orthopedist appointment (independent research - can
          happen in parallel with 1 & 2)
       4. Get diagnosis (depends on both appointments completing)

     Tasks 1 and 3 can happen in parallel - they don't depend on each
     other.

   • Step 1: Capture the Project

     ‘C-c d c’ to capture:

          * Fix Shoulder Pain
          ** Find place to get MRI
          ** Make MRI appointment
          ** Make orthopedist appointment
          ** Get diagnosis from orthopedist

   • Step 2: Organize with Custom Dependencies

     After organizing as a project (‘C-c c’ → ‘[P]’), org-gtd creates
     sequential dependencies by default.  We need to modify them for
     parallel execution.

     **Open the project file:**

     Find your project in the engage view (‘C-c d e’), press ‘RET’ on
     any task to jump to the project file.

     **The project looks like this:**

          * Fix Shoulder Pain
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ORG_GTD: Projects
          :ORG_GTD_FIRST_TASKS: <id-of-find-mri>
          :END:
          ** NEXT Find place to get MRI
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ID: <id-of-find-mri>
          :ORG_GTD: Actions
          :ORG_GTD_BLOCKS: <id-of-make-mri-appt>
          :END:
          ** TODO Make MRI appointment
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ID: <id-of-make-mri-appt>
          :ORG_GTD: Actions
          :ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON: <id-of-find-mri>
          :ORG_GTD_BLOCKS: <id-of-make-ortho-appt>
          :END:
          ** TODO Make orthopedist appointment
          ... (and so on, sequential)

   • Step 3: Modify for Parallel Execution

     We want "Find MRI place" and "Make orthopedist appointment" to be
     parallel starting tasks.

     **On the project heading**, add the orthopedist appointment ID to
     FIRST_TASKS:

          :ORG_GTD_FIRST_TASKS: <id-of-find-mri> <id-of-make-ortho-appt>

     **On "Make orthopedist appointment" task**, remove the DEPENDS_ON
     property:

     Remove the line: ‘:ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON: <id-of-make-mri-appt>’

     **On "Get diagnosis" task**, make it depend on BOTH appointments:

          :ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON: <id-of-make-mri-appt> <id-of-make-ortho-appt>

     **Fix the BLOCKS properties:**
        • Remove orthopedist appointment from MRI appointment's BLOCKS
        • Add diagnosis ID to both appointment tasks' BLOCKS

   • Step 4: Fix Keywords

     Put point on the project heading and run:

     ‘M-x org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords-for-project-at-point’

     This recalculates which tasks should be NEXT based on the
     dependency graph.

   • Step 5: See the Results

     ‘C-c d e’ to view the engage agenda.

     You'll now see:
        • *NEXT: Find place to get MRI*
        • *NEXT: Make orthopedist appointment*

     Both are NEXT simultaneously!  You can work on whichever you want.

     When you complete both appointments, "Get diagnosis" automatically
     becomes NEXT.

   • The Dependency Pattern (Diamond)

     This is called a "diamond" pattern:

              Find MRI ─────┐
                            ├──→ Get Diagnosis
          Make Ortho Appt ──┘

     Two parallel paths converge at a single task.  This is common in
     real projects.

5.4.3 Tutorial: Complex Project Dependencies
--------------------------------------------

Let's look at a more complex example: "Release Next Version of
Software".

   • The Scenario

     Steps:
       1. List features (starting task)
       2. Implement features (depends on list)
       3. Write documentation (can start after list, parallel with
          implement)
       4. Get beta tester feedback (depends on both implement AND
          documentation)
       5. Update code based on feedback (depends on beta feedback)
       6. Update documentation based on feedback (depends on beta
          feedback, parallel with code updates)
       7. Release (depends on both updates completing)

   • The Dependency Graph

          List Features
              ├──→ Implement Features ───┐
              └──→ Write Documentation ───┼──→ Get Beta Feedback
                                          │         ├──→ Update Code ─────┐
                                          │         └──→ Update Docs ──────┼──→ Release
                                          └───────────────────────────────┘

   • Key Patterns

       1. *Parallel branches* after List Features
       2. *Converging paths* at Get Beta Feedback (both branches must
          complete)
       3. *Parallel updates* after feedback
       4. *Final convergence* at Release

   • Setting This Up

     You would:
       1. Capture the project structure
       2. Organize as project (creates sequential by default)
       3. Open the project file
       4. Modify FIRST_TASKS to include only "List Features"
       5. Set DEPENDS_ON for "Implement" to only List Features
       6. Set DEPENDS_ON for "Write Documentation" to only List Features
       7. Set DEPENDS_ON for "Get Beta Feedback" to both Implement AND
          Write Documentation
       8. Set DEPENDS_ON for both Update tasks to Get Beta Feedback
       9. Set DEPENDS_ON for "Release" to both Update tasks
       10. Run ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords-for-project-at-point’


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Common Dependency Patterns,  Next: Practical Tips,  Prev: Tutorial Complex Project Dependencies,  Up: Working with Projects (Advanced)

5.4.4 Common Dependency Patterns
--------------------------------

   • Sequential Chain (A → B → C)

     The simplest pattern.  Default for all projects.

     Use when: Order matters, each task depends on the previous.

     Example: Review blueprints → Order windows → Schedule carpenter

   • Parallel Independent (A, B, C all start together)

     All tasks are in FIRST_TASKS, no dependencies between them.

     Use when: Tasks are completely independent and can all start
     immediately.

     Example: Research destinations, Check budget, Ask for time off (for
     vacation planning)

   • Fan-out (A → B, A → C, A → D)

     One task blocks multiple tasks that can then proceed in parallel.

     Use when: Initial work enables multiple independent paths.

     Example: Get project approval → (Design UI, Write backend API,
     Setup infrastructure)

   • Fan-in / Convergence (A → C, B → C)

     Multiple tasks must complete before next task can start.  Also
     called "join".

     Use when: Final task needs all previous work completed.

     Example: (Write code, Write tests) → Merge to main

   • Diamond (A → B → D, A → C → D)

     Parallel paths that converge.  Combination of fan-out and fan-in.

     Use when: Work splits, proceeds in parallel, then combines.

     Example: Research → (Write content, Design graphics) → Publish
     article


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Practical Tips,  Next: Reference Dependency Management Commands,  Prev: Common Dependency Patterns,  Up: Working with Projects (Advanced)

5.4.5 Practical Tips
--------------------

   • When to use sequential

        • Order truly matters (can't install before purchasing)
        • You're not sure what the next task will be until you complete
          the current one
        • The project is simple and you don't want to think about
          dependencies

   • When to use parallel

        • You have multiple people working on the project
        • Tasks are independent and could be done in any order
        • You want to optimize for speed
        • Clear what all tasks are upfront

   • Managing complexity

        • Start sequential, make parallel only when needed
        • Use areas of focus or tags to group related tasks
        • Keep task names clear and specific
        • Review stuck projects weekly to catch dependency issues

   • Modifying projects over time

        • Add tasks: Use "Add to existing project" when organizing new
          items
        • Change dependencies: Edit properties directly, then run
          fix-keywords command
        • Split tasks: Break down a task into sub-tasks, adjust
          dependencies
        • Merge tasks: Mark unnecessary tasks DONE or CNCL


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Reference Dependency Management Commands,  Next: Optional Visualizing Dependencies,  Prev: Practical Tips,  Up: Working with Projects (Advanced)

5.4.6 Reference: Dependency Management Commands
-----------------------------------------------

   • During organizing

     ‘org-gtd-organize’ → ‘[P]’
          Creates project with sequential dependencies (default)
     ‘org-gtd-organize’ → ‘[A]’
          Adds task to existing project

   • After organizing

     ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords-for-project-at-point’
          Recalculates NEXT tasks based on dependency graph.  Use after
          manually editing dependencies.

   • Properties to edit manually

     ‘ORG_GTD_FIRST_TASKS’
          (on project heading) Space-separated list of task IDs with no
          dependencies
     ‘ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON’
          (on task) Space-separated list of task IDs this task depends
          on
     ‘ORG_GTD_BLOCKS’
          (on task) Space-separated list of task IDs this task blocks

     After editing these properties, always run
     ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords-for-project-at-point’ to update
     task states.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Optional Visualizing Dependencies,  Next: Troubleshooting Projects,  Prev: Reference Dependency Management Commands,  Up: Working with Projects (Advanced)

5.4.7 Optional: Visualizing Dependencies
----------------------------------------

Enable visual dependency helper while clarifying projects:

     (setq org-gtd-clarify-display-helper-buffer t)

   When enabled, a side window shows task relationships as you work on a
project in the WIP buffer during clarification.

   This is useful for:
   • Understanding complex dependency graphs
   • Spotting cycles before they cause problems
   • Planning parallel execution paths

5.4.8 Troubleshooting Projects
------------------------------

   • Project is stuck (has TODO tasks but no NEXT)

     Run ‘M-x org-gtd-review-stuck-projects’ to find stuck projects.

     Common causes:
        • Circular dependency (A depends on B, B depends on A)
        • Missing FIRST_TASKS (project has no starting point)
        • All first tasks are DONE but dependencies not set up correctly

     Fix: Put point on project heading, run
     ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords-for-project-at-point’

   • Task should be NEXT but shows as TODO

     The dependency graph says it's blocked.  Check:
       1. What tasks are in its ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON?
       2. Are those tasks actually DONE?
       3. Did you forget to remove a dependency?

     Fix: Edit ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON property, run fix-keywords command.

   • Too many tasks are NEXT

     You probably have tasks that should have dependencies but don't.

     Fix: Add appropriate ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON properties to tasks that
     shouldn't start yet, run fix-keywords command.

5.4.9 Cleaning up / archiving completed work
--------------------------------------------

Doing this without user intervention is tricky, as it makes undoing
actions more complicated.  As such, Org GTD provides a function that
will go through the ‘org-gtd-directory’ files, find the headings that
belong to Org GTD (see *note Refiling to the appropriate area::), and
archive the finished items.

   The variable ‘org-gtd-archive-location’ points to a *function* that
returns a string matching the ‘org-archive-location’ definition.  It is
a function in order to allow the filename to be dynamic.

   The function to archive everything is ‘M-x
org-gtd-archive-completed-items’.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Commands you can call on org-agenda,  Next: Defining your own agenda views,  Prev: Cleaning up / archiving completed work,  Up: Working with Projects (Advanced)

5.4.10 Commands you can call on org-agenda
------------------------------------------

Since Org provides the agenda, it is a convenient base of operations for
interacting with things that come up through ‘org-gtd-engage’.

   Here are the actions available to you:

‘M-x org-gtd-delegate-agenda-item’
     When the point is on an action, this will properly delegate the
     action to someone else.
‘M-x org-gtd-project-cancel-from-agenda’
     When the point is on a project action, this command will cancel the
     remaining actions in the project.
‘M-x org-gtd-clarify-agenda-item’
     If you would like to clarify and organize an item through the
     agenda view, for whatever reason, this is your entry point.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Defining your own agenda views,  Next: Adding your own hooks when organizing,  Prev: Commands you can call on org-agenda,  Up: Working with Projects (Advanced)

5.4.11 Defining your own agenda views
-------------------------------------

You can define your own agenda views by defining your own functions like
shown below, where ‘x’ is whatever your defined key is.

     (defun my-agenda ()
       (with-org-gtd-context
           (let ((org-agenda-custom-commands '(your-definition-here)))
             (org-agenda nil "x"))))

   *See also*: For a much easier way to create custom views, see *note
View DSL Filter Reference::, which provides a declarative language for
defining views without writing skip functions.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Adding your own hooks when organizing,  Prev: Defining your own agenda views,  Up: Working with Projects (Advanced)

5.4.12 Adding your own hooks when organizing
--------------------------------------------

Adding useful metadata to the tasks allows you to enhance the agenda
view to make it more useful to you, whether it be effort, tags,
priority, or any other amount of information you might like.

   This being said, different types of tasks or items are not even
created equal.  For instance, there may be metadata you want to add to a
project heading but not its tasks, or to a calendar item and not to a
trash item.

   Org GTD therefore provides a helper function,
‘org-gtd-organize-type-member-p’, which you can use when creating your
own hooks.  The function takes one argument, a list of types (provided
in the function's documentation).  When called as part of a hook, this
function will check a buffer-local variable called
‘org-gtd--organize-type’, managed by Org GTD, to determine truthiness.

   For an example, see the source code for
‘org-gtd-areas-of-focus--set’, which will not run if the task being
organized is a project task, trash, knowledge, or a quick action.

   *See also*: For complete documentation on the hooks framework,
including many examples and best practices, see *note Hooks Framework
Reference::.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Automating through emacs,  Prev: Working with Projects (Advanced),  Up: Using Org GTD

5.5 Automating through emacs
============================

There's now a few functions you can use when you are doing work within
emacs and would like GTD to track something for you as a result:
   • ‘org-gtd-habit-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-calendar-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-delegate-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-incubate-create’
   • ‘org-gtd-single-action-create’

   See the documentation for each, but suffice it to say they all take,
at the very least, a string that will be used as the text part of the
org heading that gets stored in org-gtd.

   For instance, one way this could work:

     (defun org-gtd-email-reminder ()
       (let ((topic (message-fetch-field "subject"))
             (delegated-to (message-fetch-field "to"))
             (reminder-date (org-read-date nil nil "+3d")))
         (org-gtd-delegate-create (format "Reminder: %s" topic)
                                  delegated-to
                                  reminder-date)))

     (add-hook 'message-send-hook 'org-gtd-email-reminder)

6.2.9 Task Dependency Commands
------------------------------

These commands help manage task relationships in projects:

   • ‘org-gtd-task-add-blockers’

     *When to use*: To specify that the current task depends on other
     task(s) completing first

     *What it does*:
        • Prompts to select tasks that block the current task
        • Creates bidirectional relationships.
             • Adds selected task IDs to current task's
               ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON
             • Adds current task ID to selected tasks' ORG_GTD_BLOCKS
        • Can select multiple blockers

     *Example*:
          On task: "Get diagnosis"
          M-x org-gtd-task-add-blockers
          Select: "Make MRI appointment" and "Make orthopedist appointment"

             • Adds current task ID to selected task's
               ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON

     *Example*:
          On task: "Get project approval"
          M-x org-gtd-task-add-dependent
          Select: "Start implementation"
          Result: Implementation can't start until approval is done

   • ‘org-gtd-task-add-dependents’

     *When to use*: To specify multiple tasks that depend on the current
     task

     *What it does*:

          selections

   • ‘org-gtd-task-clear-relationships’

     *When to use*: To remove ALL dependency relationships from current
     task

     *What it does*:

          exist)
        • Finds orphaned tasks (not reachable from FIRST_TASKS)
        • Identifies circular dependencies
        • Provides guidance on fixes

     *Required*: Point must be on project heading

   • ‘org-gtd-remove-task-from-project’

     *When to use*: To remove a task from a project structure

     *What it does*:
        • Removes the project ID from task's ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS
          property
        • Doesn't delete the task, just removes project association
        • Useful when reorganizing project structures

* Standard Org Properties Used by org-gtd::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Core GTD Properties,  Next: Project Properties,  Up: Properties Reference

6.3.1 Core GTD Properties
-------------------------

   • ORG_GTD

     *Used on*: All GTD items (projects, actions, calendar items,
     incubated items, etc.)

     *Purpose*: Identifies the type of GTD item

     *Values*:
     ‘"Projects"’
          Project heading
     ‘"Actions"’
          Project tasks and single actions
     ‘"Calendar"’
          Calendar items (appointments, deadlines)
     ‘"Incubated"’
          Someday/maybe items
     ‘"Delegated"’
          Delegated tasks (set in combination with DELEGATED_TO)

     *Example*:
          * My Project
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ORG_GTD: Projects
          :END:
          ** NEXT Task 1
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ORG_GTD: Actions
          :END:

     *Note*: This property is how org-gtd identifies items.  Don't
     modify manually unless you understand the implications.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Project Properties,  Next: Task Dependency Properties,  Prev: Core GTD Properties,  Up: Properties Reference

6.3.2 Project Properties
------------------------

   • ORG_GTD_FIRST_TASKS

     *Used on*: Project headings

     *Purpose*: Identifies which tasks can start immediately (have no
     dependencies)

     *Format*: Space-separated list of task IDs

     *Example*:
          * Software Release
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ORG_GTD: Projects
          :ORG_GTD_FIRST_TASKS: abc123 def456
          :END:

     This means tasks with IDs "abc123" and "def456" can both start
     immediately (parallel execution).

     *When to modify*:
        • After organizing a project (org-gtd sets this automatically)
        • When adding parallel starting points to a project
        • Always run
          ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords-for-project-at-point’
          after manual edits


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Task Dependency Properties,  Next: Calendar and Time Properties,  Prev: Project Properties,  Up: Properties Reference

6.3.3 Task Dependency Properties
--------------------------------

   • ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON

     *Used on*: Project tasks

     *Purpose*: Lists task IDs that must complete before this task can
     start

     *Format*: Space-separated list of task IDs

     *Example*:
          ** NEXT Get project approval
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ID: task-001
          :ORG_GTD: Actions
          :ORG_GTD_BLOCKS: task-002 task-003
          :END:
          ** TODO Design solution
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ID: task-002
          :ORG_GTD: Actions
          :ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON: task-001
          :ORG_GTD_BLOCKS: task-004
          :END:
          ** TODO Setup infrastructure
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ID: task-003
          :ORG_GTD: Actions
          :ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON: task-001
          :ORG_GTD_BLOCKS: task-004
          :END:
          ** TODO Implement feature
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ID: task-004
          :ORG_GTD: Actions
          :ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON: task-002 task-003
          :END:

     In this example:
        • Task 001 (approval) starts first
        • Tasks 002 (design) and 003 (infrastructure) can run in
          parallel after approval
        • Task 004 (implement) waits for both 002 and 003 to complete

     *When to modify*:
        • When creating custom dependency structures
        • When changing task relationships
        • Always update ORG_GTD_BLOCKS on the blocking tasks too
          (bidirectional)
        • Always run
          ‘org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords-for-project-at-point’
          after edits

   • ORG_GTD_BLOCKS

     *Used on*: Project tasks

     *Purpose*: Lists task IDs that depend on this task completing
     (inverse of DEPENDS_ON)

     *Format*: Space-separated list of task IDs

     *Relationship*: If task A has ‘ORG_GTD_BLOCKS: B C’, then:
        • Task B should have ‘ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON: A’
        • Task C should have ‘ORG_GTD_DEPENDS_ON: A’

     *When to modify*:
        • Manually when setting up dependencies (maintain bidirectional
          relationship)
        • Use ‘org-gtd-task-add-dependent’ command instead of manual
          edits when possible

   • ORG_GTD_PROJECT_IDS

     *Used on*: Tasks

     *Purpose*: Lists project IDs this task belongs to (supports
     multi-project tasks)

     *Format*: Space-separated list of project IDs

     *Note*: Currently org-gtd creates one project per task, but this
     property supports future multi-project features.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Calendar and Time Properties,  Next: Delegation Properties,  Prev: Task Dependency Properties,  Up: Properties Reference

6.3.4 Calendar and Time Properties
----------------------------------

   • ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP

     *Used on*: Calendar items, delegated items

     *Purpose*: Stores the appointment time or follow-up date

     *Format*: Org timestamp (inactive timestamp)

     *Example*:
          * Doctor appointment
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ORG_GTD: Calendar
          :ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP: [2025-10-15 Wed 14:00]
          :END:

     *Why not use SCHEDULED*: org-gtd uses a custom property to
     distinguish between "do this at this time" (GTD calendar items) and
     "start working on this sometime after this date" (org-mode
     scheduling).

     *When to modify*: Use ‘org-gtd-organize’ to change calendar items
     rather than manual edits.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Delegation Properties,  Next: Habit Properties,  Prev: Calendar and Time Properties,  Up: Properties Reference

6.3.5 Delegation Properties
---------------------------

   • DELEGATED_TO

     *Used on*: Delegated items

     *Purpose*: Stores the name of person/team the task is delegated to

     *Format*: String (person's name)

     *Example*:
          * Review document
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ORG_GTD: Delegated
          :DELEGATED_TO: Alice Smith
          :ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP: [2025-10-18 Fri]
          :END:

     *When to modify*: Use ‘org-gtd-delegate-agenda-item’ or organize
     flow rather than manual edits.

     *Customization*: Set ‘org-gtd-delegate-read-func’ to customize how
     names are entered (e.g., for completion).


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Habit Properties,  Next: Area of Focus Properties,  Prev: Delegation Properties,  Up: Properties Reference

6.3.6 Habit Properties
----------------------

   • STYLE

     *Used on*: Habits

     *Purpose*: Identifies item as an org-mode habit

     *Value*: ‘"habit"’

     *Example*:
          * TODO Exercise
          SCHEDULED: <2025-10-11 Fri .+1d>
          :PROPERTIES:
          :STYLE: habit
          :END:

     *Note*: This is a standard org-mode habit property.  See org-mode
     documentation for habit repeat patterns and configuration.

6.3.7 Area of Focus Properties
------------------------------

   • CATEGORY

     *Used on*: All items (when using areas of focus)

     *Purpose*: Identifies which area of focus (GTD Horizon 2) an item
     belongs to

     *Format*: String matching value from ‘org-gtd-areas-of-focus’

     *Example*:
          * Finish quarterly report
          :PROPERTIES:
          :ORG_GTD: Actions
          :CATEGORY: Work
          :END:

     *When to set*:
        • During organize, if ‘org-gtd-set-area-of-focus’ is in
          ‘org-gtd-organize-hooks’
        • Manually with ‘org-gtd-area-of-focus-set-on-item-at-point’
        • From agenda with ‘org-gtd-area-of-focus-set-on-agenda-item’

     *Use*: Filter views by area with ‘org-gtd-review-area-of-focus’ or
     custom views.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Standard Org Properties Used by org-gtd,  Prev: Area of Focus Properties,  Up: Properties Reference

6.3.8 Standard Org Properties Used by org-gtd
---------------------------------------------

   • ID

     *Used on*: All GTD items

     *Purpose*: Unique identifier for the item (org-mode standard)

     *Format*: Auto-generated UUID

     *Note*: org-gtd relies heavily on IDs for task relationships.
     Don't delete ID properties.

   • *TODO* keyword

     *Not a property, but a heading keyword*

     *Values used by org-gtd*:
        • Value from ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’'s ‘todo’ key (default
          "TODO")
        • Value from ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’'s ‘next’ key (default
          "NEXT")
        • Value from ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’'s ‘wait’ key (default
          "WAIT")
        • Value from ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’'s ‘canceled’ key (default
          "CNCL")
        • ‘"DONE"’ (standard org-mode)

   • SCHEDULED (org-mode standard)

     *Used on*: Habits primarily

     *Purpose*: For org-mode habits, defines repeat pattern

     *Note*: org-gtd uses ORG_GTD_TIMESTAMP for calendar items instead
     of SCHEDULED to maintain GTD semantics.

   • DEADLINE (org-mode standard)

     *Used on*: Items with hard deadlines

     *Purpose*: Mark items that must be done by a specific date

     *Note*: org-gtd respects org-mode deadlines in all views and oops
     checks.

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Creating Custom Views,  Prev: Complete View Examples,  Up: View DSL Filter Reference

6.4.12 Creating Custom Views
----------------------------

To create a custom view:

  1. **Define the view specification**:
          (defun my-custom-view ()
            "Description of what this view shows."
            (interactive)
            (org-gtd-view-show
             '((name . "View Name")
               (filters . ((filter1 . value1)
                           (filter2 . value2))))))

  2. **Bind to a key** (optional):
          (global-set-key (kbd "C-c d v") 'my-custom-view)

  3. **Test and refine** - Run the view and adjust filters as needed

6.5 Hooks Framework Reference
=============================

org-gtd provides hooks to customize behavior when organizing items.
This section documents the hooks framework and how to write custom
hooks.

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: The org-gtd-organize-hooks Variable,  Next: Built-in Hooks,  Up: Hooks Framework Reference

6.5.1 The org-gtd-organize-hooks Variable
-----------------------------------------

*Type*: List of functions

   *When run*: During ‘org-gtd-organize’, after you choose item type but
before refiling

   *Purpose*: Add metadata (tags, properties, etc.)  to items as they're
organized

   *Default value*: ‘'(org-set-tags-command)’


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Built-in Hooks,  Next: Writing Custom Hooks,  Prev: The org-gtd-organize-hooks Variable,  Up: Hooks Framework Reference

6.5.2 Built-in Hooks
--------------------

   • ‘org-set-tags-command’

     *What it does*: Prompts for tags to add to the item

     *Use when*: You want to tag items during organization (default)

     *To use*:
          (setq org-gtd-organize-hooks '(org-set-tags-command))

   • ‘org-gtd-set-area-of-focus’

     *What it does*: Prompts for area of focus (from
     ‘org-gtd-areas-of-focus’) and sets CATEGORY property

     *Use when*: You use GTD Horizon 2 (areas of focus)

     *To use*:
          (setq org-gtd-organize-hooks '(org-set-tags-command
                                         org-gtd-set-area-of-focus))

     *Behavior*: Skips prompt for:
        • Project tasks (sets on project instead)
        • Trash items
        • Knowledge items
        • Quick actions


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Writing Custom Hooks,  Next: Example Custom Hooks,  Prev: Built-in Hooks,  Up: Hooks Framework Reference

6.5.3 Writing Custom Hooks
--------------------------

Custom hooks are functions that run during organization.  They can:
   • Add properties
   • Set tags
   • Modify heading text
   • Prompt for information
   • Skip certain item types

   • Basic Hook Structure

          (defun my-organize-hook ()
            "Description of what this hook does."
            (interactive)  ;; hooks can be interactive or not
            ;; Your code here
            ;; Point will be on the heading being organized
            ;; Use org-mode functions to modify it
            )

   • Using org-gtd-organize-type-member-p

     This helper function lets you run code only for specific item
     types.

     *Function signature*:
          (org-gtd-organize-type-member-p TYPE-LIST)

     *Arguments*:
     ‘TYPE-LIST’
          List of item type symbols to check against

     *Returns*: ‘t’ if current item matches one of the types, ‘nil’
     otherwise

     *Available types*:
     ‘'action’
          Single actions
     ‘'project’
          Project headings
     ‘'project-task’
          Tasks within projects
     ‘'calendar’
          Calendar items
     ‘'delegate’
          Delegated items
     ‘'incubate’
          Someday/maybe items
     ‘'habit’
          Habits
     ‘'knowledge’
          Reference items
     ‘'quick’
          Quick actions (<2 min)
     ‘'trash’
          Trashed items

     *Example*: Only run for actions and projects:
          (defun my-hook ()
            (when (org-gtd-organize-type-member-p '(action project))
              ;; do something
              ))

File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Hook Execution Order,  Next: Best Practices,  Prev: Example Custom Hooks,  Up: Hooks Framework Reference

6.5.5 Hook Execution Order
--------------------------

Hooks run in the order they appear in ‘org-gtd-organize-hooks’.

   *Example*: Set area first, then tags:
     (setq org-gtd-organize-hooks
           '(org-gtd-set-area-of-focus  ;; runs first
             org-set-tags-command))      ;; runs second

   This order matters if one hook depends on another's results.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Best Practices,  Next: Complete Example Comprehensive Hook Setup,  Prev: Hook Execution Order,  Up: Hooks Framework Reference

6.5.6 Best Practices
--------------------

  1. **Use type checking**: Always use ‘org-gtd-organize-type-member-p’
     to run hooks only for relevant item types

  2. **Keep hooks focused**: Each hook should do one thing well

  3. **Make hooks optional**: Use ‘y-or-n-p’ for optional metadata:
          (when (y-or-n-p "Add custom property? ")
            (org-set-property "PROP" value))

  4. **Test interactively**: Make hooks interactive for testing:
          (defun my-hook ()
            (interactive)  ;; can test with M-x my-hook
            ...)

  5. **Handle errors gracefully**: Wrap risky code in condition-case:
          (condition-case err
              (my-risky-operation)
            (error (message "Hook failed: %s" err)))

  6. **Document your hooks**: Add docstrings explaining what each hook
     does

6.5.7 Complete Example: Comprehensive Hook Setup
------------------------------------------------

     ;; Custom hooks for org-gtd
     (defun my-add-effort ()

       (when (org-gtd-organize-type-member-p '(action project))

     (defun my-add-priority ()

           (when (string-match-p "\\(computer\\|code\\|write\\)" heading)
             (push "@computer" suggested-tags))
           (when (string-match-p "\\(store\\|buy\\|shop\\)" heading)
             (push "@errands" suggested-tags))
           (when suggested-tags
             (message "Suggested contexts: %s" (string-join suggested-tags ", "))))))

     (defun my-track-creation-date ()
       "Add CREATED property with current timestamp."
       (unless (org-gtd-organize-type-member-p '(trash quick))
         (org-set-property "CREATED"
                           (format-time-string "[%Y-%m-%d %a %H:%M]"))))

     ;; Install hooks
     (setq org-gtd-organize-hooks
           '(org-gtd-set-area-of-focus  ;; set area first
             org-set-tags-command        ;; then tags
             my-auto-tag-contexts        ;; suggest context tags
             my-add-effort               ;; estimate effort
             my-add-priority             ;; set priority if needed
             my-track-creation-date))    ;; track when created

   This creates a comprehensive metadata capture workflow during
organization.

7 Troubleshooting
*****************

This section covers common problems and their solutions.  For complete
command documentation, see *note Commands Reference::.

* Menu:

* Finding lost tasks::
* Projects without a NEXT item::
* I can't create a project when clarifying an inbox item!::
* Configuration problems::
* Still stuck?::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Finding lost tasks,  Next: Projects without a NEXT item,  Up: Troubleshooting

7.1 Finding lost tasks
======================

Sometimes items get stuck or fall through the cracks.  org-gtd provides
several commands to find problematic items:

‘org-gtd-review-stuck-calendar-items’
     Calendar items with invalid or missing timestamps
‘org-gtd-review-stuck-incubated-items’
     Incubated items with invalid or missing review dates
‘org-gtd-review-stuck-habit-items’
     Habits with incorrect configuration
‘org-gtd-review-stuck-delegated-items’
     Delegated items missing delegate or date information
‘org-gtd-review-stuck-single-action-items’
     Single actions that aren't marked as NEXT
‘org-gtd-review-stuck-projects’
     Projects that have tasks but no NEXT actions
‘org-gtd-review-missed-items’
     Items that should have been processed but weren't

   See *note Commands Reference:: for detailed documentation of these
commands.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Projects without a NEXT item,  Next: I can't create a project when clarifying an inbox item!,  Prev: Finding lost tasks,  Up: Troubleshooting

7.2 Projects without a NEXT item
================================

If a project has active tasks but none are marked NEXT, this usually
indicates:
  1. Missing dependency configuration (no ‘ORG_GTD_FIRST_TASKS’
     property)
  2. org-edna is not enabled
  3. Dependency properties need recalculation

   *Solution*: Put the point on the project heading and run ‘M-x
org-gtd-projects-fix-todo-keywords-for-project-at-point’.

   *Note*: Make sure org-edna is enabled: ‘(org-edna-mode 1)’ in your
init file.  See *note Configuring:: for setup instructions.

   See also: *note Working with Projects (Advanced):: for complete
project troubleshooting guide.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: I can't create a project when clarifying an inbox item!,  Next: Configuration problems,  Prev: Projects without a NEXT item,  Up: Troubleshooting

7.3 I can't create a project when clarifying an inbox item!
===========================================================

When organizing an item as a project, org-gtd expects a specific
structure:

     * Project heading
     ** First task
     ** Second task
     ** Third task

   *Common issues*:
   • Top-level heading must be a single asterisk ‘*’
   • Tasks must be second-level headings ‘**’
   • Must have at least one task under the project heading

   See *note data shape requirements:: for complete details.

   If this doesn't solve your problem, please open an issue at
<https://github.com/Trevoke/org-gtd.el/issues> with:
  1. The exact structure of your item in the clarify buffer
  2. What happens when you try to organize it
  3. Any error messages

7.4 Configuration problems
==========================

* Menu:

* Keywords not working::
* Items not showing in engage view::


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Keywords not working,  Next: Items not showing in engage view,  Up: Configuration problems

7.4.1 Keywords not working
--------------------------

If TODO keywords aren't changing correctly:

  1. *Check ‘org-todo-keywords’ includes all GTD keywords in one
     sequence*:
          (setq org-todo-keywords
                '((sequence "TODO" "NEXT" "WAIT" "|" "DONE" "CNCL")))

  2. *Check ‘org-gtd-keyword-mapping’ maps to those keywords*:
          (setq org-gtd-keyword-mapping
                '((todo . "TODO")
                  (next . "NEXT")
                  (wait . "WAIT")
                  (canceled . "CNCL")))

  3. *Remove any ‘#+TODO:’ lines from GTD org files*

   See *note Configuring:: for complete setup instructions.


File: org-gtd.info,  Node: Items not showing in engage view,  Prev: Keywords not working,  Up: Configuration problems

7.4.2 Items not showing in engage view
--------------------------------------

If items aren't appearing in ‘org-gtd-engage’:

  1. *Check org-agenda-files includes org-gtd-directory*:
          (setq org-agenda-files (list org-gtd-directory))

  2. *Check item has correct properties*:
        • Single actions should have ‘ORG_GTD: Actions’ and TODO keyword
          NEXT
        • Project tasks should have ‘ORG_GTD: Actions’ and be part of a
          project

  3. *Verify org-edna is enabled*:
          (org-edna-mode 1)

   See *note Configuration Variables Reference:: for all configuration
options.
